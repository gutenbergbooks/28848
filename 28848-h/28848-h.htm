<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Elijah Rasba lived alone in a log cabin on
Temple Run. He was a long, lank, blue-eyed
young man, with curly brown hair and a pale,
almost livid complexion. His eye-brows were heavy
and dark brown, and the blue steel of his gaze was fixed
unwaveringly upon any object that it distinguished.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Two generations before, Old Abe Rasba had built
a church on a little brook, a tributary of Jackson River,
away up in the mountains. The church was laid up of
flat stones, gathered in fields, from ledges of rock and
up the wooded mountain side. It was large enough
to hold all the people for miles around, and the roof
was supported by massive hewn timbers, and some
few attempts had been made to decorate the structure.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Old Abe had called his church &#8220;The Temple,&#8221; had
preached from a big hollow oak stump, and laid down
the Law of the Bible, which he had memorized by heart,
and expounded from experience. Elijah Rasba, grandson
of Old Abe, thus came honestly by reverence and
religion, but the strange glory which had surrounded
the old Temple had departed from the ruin, and of
all the congregation, only Elijah remained.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Land-slips had ruined a score of farms cleared on too-steep
hills; lightning had destroyed the overshot grist
mill, and the two big stones had been cracked in the hot
flames; a feud had opened graves before the allotted
time of the victims. It seemed to Elijah, sitting there
in his cabin, as though damnation had visited the faithful,
and that death was the reward of belief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The ruins of the old Temple stood melancholy where
the heavy stone wall, built by a man who believed in
broad, firm foundations, had split an avalanche, but
without avail, for the walls had given way and let the
roof beams drop in. No less certain had been the fate
of the congregation; they, too, were scattered or dead.
There remained but one dwelling in the little valley,
with a lone occupant, who was wrestling with his soul,
trying to understand, for he knew in his heart that
he must read the truth and discover the meaning of all
this trouble, privation, disaster, and death.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He was quite practical about it. He had a field of
corn, and a little garden full of truck; over his fireplace
hung a 32-20 repeating rifle, and in one corner were a
number of steel traps, copper and brass wire for snares,
and a home-made mattock with which a rabbit could be
extricated from a burrow, or a skunk-skin from its den.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>An Almanac, a Bible, and a &#8220;Resources of Tennessee&#8221;
comprised the library on the shelf. The Almanac
had come by mail from away off yonder, about a hundred
miles, perhaps&mdash;anyhow, from New York. The
&#8220;Resources of Tennessee&#8221; had come down with a spring
freshet in Jackson River, and was rather stained with
mountain clays. The Bible was, of course, an inheritance.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was a very small article, apparently, to create all
the disturbances that seemed to have followed its interpretations
there on Temple Run. Elijah would hold
it out at arms length and stare at it with those sharp
eyes of his, wondering in his soul how it could be that
the fate of nations, the future of humanity, the very
salvation of every soul rested within the compass of
that leather-covered, gilt-edged parcel of thin paper
which weighed rather less than half as much as a box
of cartridges.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Elijah did not spare himself in the least. He toiled
at whatever task appeared for him to do. As he required
for his own wants fifty bushels of corn for a year,
he planted enough to shuck a hundred bushels. Once,
in the fervour of the hope that he was called upon to
raise corn for humanity, he raised five hundred bushels,
only to give it all away to poor white trash who had not
raised enough for themselves.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Again he felt the call to preach, and he went forth
with all the eagerness of a man who had at last discovered
his life&#8217;s calling. He went on foot, through storms,
over mountains, and into a hundred schoolhouses and
churches, showing his little leather-skinned Bible and
warning sinners to repent, Christians to keep faith,
and Baal to lower his loathly head.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had returned from his five months&#8217; pilgrimage
with the feeling that his utmost efforts had been futile,
and that for all his good will, it had not been vouchsafed
him to leave behind one thought in fertile soil. The
matter had been brought home to him by an incident
of the last meeting he had addressed, over on Clinch.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In the Painted Church he had volunteered a sermon,
and no sermons had been preached there in years.
Feuds, inextricably tangled, had involved five different
families, and members of all those families were in the
church, answering to his challenge.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They sat there with rifles or shotguns between their
knees, with their pistols on their hips, and eternal vigilance
in their eyes. While listening to his sermon they
kept their gaze fastened upon one another, lest an unwary
moment bring upon them the alert shot of an
enemy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As he had stood there, gaunt in frame, famished of
soul, driven by the torments of an ambition to see the
right, to do it, it seemed to him as though the final burden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
had been heaped upon him, and that he must
break under the weight on his mind.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What can I say to you all?&#8221; he burst out with sudden
passion. &#8220;Theh yo&#8217; set with guns in yo&#8217; hands an&#8217;
murder in yo&#8217; souls&mdash;to listen to the word of God!
How do yo&#8217; expect the Prince of Peace to come to yo&#8217;
if yo&#8217; set there thataway?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His indignation rose as he saw them, and his scorn unbridled
his tongue, so that in a few minutes the congregation
watched one another less, the preacher more, and all
settled back, to listen and blink under his accusations
and his declarations. It really seemed, for the time, as
though he had caught and engaged their attention. But
when the sermon ended and he had taken his departure,
before he was a hundred yards down the road he heard
loud words, angry shouts, and then the scream of a woman.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The next instant there came a salvo of gun and pistol
shots and in all directions up and down the cross-roads
people fled on horseback. Three men had been killed,
five wounded and a dozen become fugitives from justice
at the end of the church service.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Elijah Rasba fled homeward, his will and hopes
broken, and sank dejectedly into a slough of despondency.
All his good intentions, all the inspiration of
his endeavour, his very spiritual exaltation had terminated
in a tragedy, as inexplicable as it was depressing.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His conscience would neither let him rest nor work.
He looked at his Bible, inside and out, the very fibres
of his brain struggling by reason, by effort, by main
strength, to discover what his duty was. No answer
soothed his waking hours or gave him rest from his
dreams. On him rested a kind of superstitious scorn
and fear, and he began to believe the whisperings of
his neighbours which reached his ears. They said:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;s possessed!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>To his own freighted mind the statement seemed to
be true. He did not know what new sin he had committed,
nor could he look back on long years of his
youth and young manhood and discover any sin which
he had not already expiated, over and over again. He
had obeyed the scriptural injunctions to the best of his
knowledge, and the reward was this daily and nightly
torment, the scorn of his fellows, and the questioning
of his own soul.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Worst of all, constructively, he had given feud fighters
the chance to do murder upon one another. Under
the guise of preaching for them for the good of their
souls, he had enabled them to meet in antagonism,
watch in wrath, and kill without mercy. Too late he
realized that he should have foreseen the tragedy, and
that he should have provided against it by going first
to each faction, preaching to each family, and then,
when he had brought them to their knees, united them
in the common cause of religion.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;On me is Thy wrath!&#8221; he cried out in the anguish
of his soul. &#8220;Give thy tortured slave something good
to do, ere I go down!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There was no reply, immediate or audible; he was
near the limits of his endurance; he drew his arm back
to throw the Bible into the flames of his fireplace, but
that he could not do. He tossed it upon the shelf,
drew his hat down upon his ears and at the approach of
night started over the ridges to the Kalbean stillhouse.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He stalked down a ridge into that split-board shack
of infamy. He found five or six men in the hot, sour-smelling
place. They started to their feet when they
saw the mountain preacher among them.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Gimme some!&#8221; he told Old Kalbean. &#8220;I&#8217;m a fool!
I&#8217;m damned. I&#8217;ll go with the rest of ye to Hell!
Gimme some!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Wha&mdash;What?&#8221; Old Kalbean choked with horror.
&#8220;Yo&#8217; gwine to drink, Parson?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Suttinly!&#8221; Rasba cried. &#8220;Hit ain&#8217; no ust for me
to preach! I preach, an&#8217; the congregation murders one
anotheh! Ef I don&#8217;t preach, I cayn&#8217;t live peaceable!
They say hit makes a man happy&mdash;I ain&#8217; be&#8217;n happy,
not in ten, not in twenty yeahs!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He caught up the jug that rested on the floor, threw
the tin cup to one side, up-ended the receptacle, and
the moonshiner and his customers stared.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Theh!&#8221; Rasba grunted, when he had to take the jug
down for breath. He reached into his pocket, drew out a
silver dollar, and handed it to the amazed mountain man.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Theh!&#8221; he repeated, defiantly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve shore gone
to Hell, now, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t give a damn, nuther. S&#8217;long,
boys! D&#8217;rectly, yo&#8217;l heah me jes&#8217; a whoopin&#8217;, yas
suh! Jes&#8217; a whoopin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He left them abruptly and he went up into the darkness
of the laurels. They heard him crashing away into
the night. When he was gone the men looked at one
another:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yo&#8217; &#8217;low he&#8217;ll bring the revenuers?&#8221; one asked, nervously.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Bring nothin&#8217;!&#8221; another grinned. &#8220;No man eveh

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They listened for the promised whoops; they strained
their ears for the cries of jubilation; but none came.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Co&#8217;rse,&#8221; the stiller explained, as though an explanation

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Virtue had not been rewarded. This much
was clear and plain to the consciousness of
Nelia Carline. Looking at herself in the glass
disclosed no special reason why she should be unhappy
and suffering. She was a pretty girl; everybody said
that, and envy said she was too pretty. It seemed that
poor folks had no right to be good-looking, anyhow.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>If poor folks weren&#8217;t good-looking, then wealthy
young men, with nothing better to do, wouldn&#8217;t go
around looking among poor folks for pretty girls.
Augustus Carline had, apparently, done that. Carline
had a fortune that had been increased during three generations,
and now he didn&#8217;t have to work. That was
bad in Gage, Illinois. It had never done any one any
good, that kind of living. One of the fruits of the matter
was when Nelia Crele&#8217;s pretty face attracted his attention.
She lived in a shack up the Bottoms near
St. Genevieve, and he tried to flirt with her, but she
wouldn&#8217;t flirt.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In some surprise, startled by his rebuff, he withdrew
from the scene with a memory that would not forget.
The scene was a wheat field near the Turkey bayou,
where he was hunting wild ducks with a shotgun. She
had been gathering forty pounds of hickory nuts to eke
out a meagre food supply.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Poor she might be; ill clad was her strong young
figure; her face showed the strain of years of effort;
her eyes had the fire of experience in suffering; and she
stood, a supple girl of heightened beauty while the
hunter, sure of his welcome, walked up to her, and, as
both her hands held the awkward bushel basket, ventured
to tickle her under the chin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She dropped the basket and before it reached the
ground she caught the rash youth broad-handed from
cheek to back of the ear, and he stumbled over a pile of
wheat sheaves and fell headlong. As he had dropped
his shotgun, she picked it up and with her thumb on
the safety, her finger on the trigger, and her left hand
on the breech, showed him how a $125 shotgun looks in
the hands of one who could and would use it on any
further provocation.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He took his departure, and she carried the gun and
hickory nuts home with her. Thus began the inauspicious
acquaintance of Nelia Crele and Augustus
Carline. The shotgun was very useful to the young
woman. She killed gray and fox squirrels, wild turkeys,
geese and ducks, several saleable fur-bearers, and other
game in her neighbourhood. She told no one how she
obtained the weapon, merely saying she had found it;
and Augustus Carline did not pass any remarks on the
subject.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>By and by, however, when the tang of the slap and
the passion of the moment had left him, he knew that
he had been foolish and cowardly. He had some good
parts, and he was sorry that he had been precipitate
in his attentions. After that encounter, he found the
girls he met at dances lacked a certain appearance, a
kindling of the eye, a complexion, and, a figure.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He ventured again into the river bottoms across
from St. Genevieve and fortune favoured him while
tricking her. He apologized and gave his name.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia was poor, abjectly poor. Her father was no
&#8217;count, and her mother was abject in suffering. One
brother had gone West, a whisky criminal; a sister had
gone wrong, with the inheritance of moral obliquity.
Nelia had, somehow, become possessed with a hate and
horror of wrong. She had pictured to herself a home,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
happiness, and a life of plenty, but she held herself at
the highest price a woman demands.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>That price Augustus Carline was only too willing to
pay. He had found a girl of high spirits, of great good
looks, of a most amusing quickness of wit and vigour
of mentality. He married her, to the scandal of everybody,
and carried her from her poverty to the fine old
French-days mansion in Gage.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There he installed her with everything he thought she
needed, and&mdash;pursued his usual futile life. Too late
she learned that he was weak, insignificant, and, like
her own father, no &#8217;count. Augustus Carline was a
brute, a creature of appetites and desires, who by no
chance rose to the heights of his wife&#8217;s mental demands.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia Carline regarded the tragedy of her life with
impatience. She studied the looking glass to see wherein
she had failed to measure up to her duty; she ransacked
her mind, and compared it with all the women she met
by virtue of her place as Gus Carline&#8217;s wife. Those
women had not proved to be what she had expected
grand dames of society to be.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I want to talk learning,&#8221; she told herself, &#8220;and
they talk hairpins and dirty dishes and Bill-don&#8217;t-behave!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Now one of those women, a kind of a grass widow,
Mrs. Plosell, had attracted Gus Carline, and when he
came home from her house, he was always drunk.
When Nelia remonstrated, he was ugly. He had
thrown her down and gone back to the grass widow&#8217;s
the night before. Nelia considered that grim fact,
and, having made up her mind, acted.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In her years of poverty she had learned many things,
and now she put into service certain practical ideas.
She had certain rights, under the law, since she had
taken the name of Augustus Carline. There were, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
moral rights, and she preferred to exercise her moral
rights.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Part of the Carline fortune was in unregistered stocks
and bonds, and when Gus Carline returned from the
widow&#8217;s one day he found that Nelia was in great good

and so very pleasant during the two days of his headache
that he was willing to do anything she asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She asked him to have a good time with her, and
put down on the table before him a filled punch bowl
and two glasses. He had never known the refinements
of intoxicating liquors. Now he found them in his
own home, and for a while forgot all else.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He sang, danced, laughed and, in due course, signed
a number of papers, receipts, bills and checks to settle
up some accounts. These were sort of hit-or-miss,
between-the-acts affairs, to which he paid little attention.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>To Nelia, however, they represented a rite as valid
as any solemn court procedure could be, for to her river-trained
instinct there was no moral question as to the
justice of her claim upon a part of Carline&#8217;s fortune.
Her later experience, her reading, had taught her that
society and the law also held with the principle, if
not the manner of her primitive method, for obtaining
her rights to separate support.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When Carline awakened, Nelia was gone. Nelia had
departed that morning, one of the servants said. The
girl did not know where she had gone. She had taken
a box of books, two trunks, two suitcases and was dressed
up, departing in the automobile, which she drove herself.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had a feeling of alarm, which he banished as unworthy.
Finally toward night he went down to the
post office where he found several letters. One seared
his consciousness;

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Elijah Rasba stalked homeward from the
still in the dark, grimly and expectantly erect.
Now he was going to have that period of happiness
which he knew was the chief reason for people
drinking moonshine whiskey. He looked forward to
the sensation of exuberant joy very much as a man
would look forward to five hours of happiness, to be
followed by hanging by the neck, till dead.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The stars were shining, and the over-ridge trail which
he followed was familiar enough under his feet, once
he had struck into it from the immediate vicinity of the
lawbreakers. He saw the bare-limbed oak trees
against the sky, and he heard rabbits and other night
runners scurrying away in the dead leaves. The stars
fluttering in the sky were stern eyes whose gaze he
avoided with determined wickedness and unrepentance.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Arriving at his own cabin, he stirred up the big pine-root
log, and drew his most comfortable rocking chair
up before the leaping flames. He sat there, and waited
for the happiness of mind which was the characteristic
of his idea of intoxication.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He waited for it, all ready to welcome it. If it had
come into his cabin, all dressed up like some image of
temptation or allurement, he would not have been in
the least surprised. He rather expected a real and
tangible manifestation, a vision of delight, clothed in
some fair figure. He sat there, rigidly, watching for the
least symptom of unholy pleasure. He had no clock
by which to tell the time, and his watch was thoroughly
unreliable.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Again and again he poked up the fire. He was surprised,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
at last, to hear a far-away gobble, the welcome of
a wild turkey for the first false dawn. By and by he
became conscious of the light which was crowding the
fire flare into a subordinate place.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Day had arrived, and as yet, the delight which everybody
said was in moonshine whiskey had failed to touch
him. However, he knew that he was not properly in a
receptive mood for happiness. His soul was still stubborn
against the allurements of sin. He stirred from his
chair, fried a rabbit in a pan, and baked a batch of hot-bread
in a dutch oven, brewing strong coffee and bringing
out the jug of sorghum molasses.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He ate breakfast. He was conscious of a certain
rigidity of action, a certain precision of motion, ascribing
them to the stern determination which he had
that when he should at last discover the whiskey-happiness
in his soul, he would let go with a whoop.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Some hit makes happy, and some hit makes fightin&#8217;
mad!&#8221; Rasba suddenly thought, with much concern,
&#8220;S&#8217;posen hit&#8217;d make me fightin&#8217; mad?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A fluttering trepidation clutched his heart. The
bells ringing in his ears fairly clanged the alarm. He
hadn&#8217;t looked for anything else but joy from being
drunk, and now suppose he should be stricken with a
mad desire to fight&mdash;to kill someone!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No deadlier fear ever clutched a man&#8217;s heart than
the one that seized Elijah Rasba. Suppose that when
the deferred hilarity arrived, he was made fighting
drunk instead of joyous? The thought seized his soul
and he looked about himself wondering how he could
chain his hands and save his soul from murder, violence,
fighting, and similar crimes! No feasible way appeared
to his frightened mind.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He dropped on his knees and began to pray for happiness,
instead of for violence, when the drink that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
had had should seize him in its embrace. He prayed
with a voice that roared like thunder and which made
the charcoal fall from the log in the fireplace, and which
alarmed the jays and inquisitive mockingbirds about
the little clearing.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He prayed while his voice grew huskier and huskier,
and his head bowed lower and lower as he wrestled with
this peril which he had not foreseen. All he asked was
that when the moonshine began to operate, it make him
laugh instead of mad, but terrible doubts smote him.
A glance at his rifle on the wall made him fairly grovel
on the floor, and he knew that in his hands the andirons,
the axe, the very hot-bread rolling pin would be
deadly weapons.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He hoped that he would not be able to shoot straight,
but this hope was instantly blasted, for a flock of wild
turkeys came down into the cornfield about ninety
yards from his cabin, and although he seldom shot anything
in his own clearing, he now tried a shot at the
turkey gobbler and shot it dead where it strutted. If
he should be stricken with anger instead of with joy,
no worse man could possibly live! There was no telling
what he would do if the liquor would work &#8220;wrong&#8221;
on him. He could kill men at two hundred yards!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He determined that he would see no human beings
that day. Few people ever visited him in his cabin,
but he took no chances. He crept up the mountain
and skulking through the woods found an immense
patch of laurels. He crawled into it, and sat down there
for hours and hours, so that no one should have an
opportunity to speak to him and stir the latent devil of
violence.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He returned to his cabin long after dark, and raking
some hot coals out of the ashes, whittled splinters and
started a blaze.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
He was assailed by hunger, and he baked corn pones
and dry-salted pork, then added a great flapjack of
delicious sage sausage to the meal. He brought out
cans of fruit, whose juice assuaged his increasing thirst.
Having eaten heartily he resumed his vigil before the
fireplace, and then he noticed that some one had tied
something on the stock of his rifle.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was a letter which a passer-by had brought up
from the Ford Post Office, and when he opened it
and looked at the writing, remorse assailed him:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:0.0em; '><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Parsun</span>:</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba read the letter for the words at first. Then he
went back after the meaning, and the meaning struck
him like a blow in the heart.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Me pray fo&#8217; any man again,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Lawse!
Lawse!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He didn&#8217;t feel fit to pray for himself, let alone for any
other sinner, but there came to his memory a picture of
Mrs. Drones, a motherly little woman who had taken
him home to a dinner at which seven kinds of preserved
fruit were on the table, and where the family laughed
around the fireplace&mdash;only to see Jock a fugitive the
next night, and the terrors of a feud war upon them.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And Jock&#8217;s getting bad down the Mississippi
River!&#8221; Rasba repeated to himself, striving to grapple
with that fact. He could not think clearly or coherently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
The widow&#8217;s voice, however, was as clearly
speaking in his thoughts as though she stood there,
instead of merely having written to him. He took to
walking up and down the floor, back and forth, on one
plank.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had forgotten that there was such a thing for
humans as sleep. The incongruity of his having been
wide awake for two days and two nights did not occur to
him till suddenly his eyes turned to the bed in the corner
of the room and its purpose was recalled to his
mind. He blinked at it. His eyes opened with difficulty.
He threw chunks on the fire and went toward
the bed, but as he stood by it the world grew black before
his eyes and clutching about him, he sank to the
floor.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia Carline would not return to that miserable
little river-bottom cabin where she had
grown up in unhappy privation. She had other
plans. She drove the little automobile down to Chester,
put it in the Star Garage, then walked to the river
bank and gave the eddy a critical inspection.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For years she had lived between the floods of the
river and the poverty of the uplands. Her life had
often crossed that of river people, and although she
had never been on the river, she had frequently gone
visiting shanty-boaters who had landed in for a night
or a week at the bank opposite her own shack home.
She knew river men, and she had no illusions about river
women. Best of all now, in her great emergency, she
knew shanty-boats, and as she gazed at the eddy and
saw the fleet of houseboats there her heart leaped exultantly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No less than a score of boats were landed along the
eddy bank, and instantly her eyes fell upon first one
and then another that would serve her purpose. She
walked down to the uppermost of the boats, and hailed
from the bank:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;U-whoo!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A lank, stoop-shouldered woman emerged from the
craft and fixed the well-favoured young woman with
keen, bright eyes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You-all know if there&#8217;s a shanty-boat here for sale&mdash;cheap?&#8221;
Nelia asked, without eagerness.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The woman looked at the bank, reflectively.</p>

back, who was green on the river, but he let us kind of
p&#8217;int out what he&#8217;d need fo&#8217; a skift trip down this away.
Real friendly feller, kind of city-like, an&#8217; sort of out&#8217;n

magazines an&#8217; books an&#8217; histries an&#8217; them kind of things.
Lawsy! He could ask questions, four hundred kinds
of questions, an&#8217; writin&#8217; hit all down into a writin&#8217;
machine onto paper. We shore told him a heap an&#8217; a

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia shrugged her shoulders. Mrs. Tons, the river
woman, gazed for a minute at the pretty, partly averted
face. It was almost desperate, quite reckless, and by
the expression, the river woman understood. She
thought in silence, for a minute, and then looked down
the eddy at a boat some distance away.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Theh&#8217;s a boat. Like the looks of it?&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia sat down in the shanty-boat, and waited. She
had not long to wait. A tall, rather burly man returned
with the woman, who introduced the two;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Mis&#8217; Crele, this is Frank Commer. His bo&#8217;t&#8217;s fo&#8217;

stoves, a brass bedstead, an&#8217; everything and I
said hit&#8217;s reasonable. Hit&#8217;s a pine boat, built last fall,
and the hull&#8217;s sound, with oak framing. Co&#8217;se, hit&#8217;s
small, 22 foot long an&#8217; 7 foot wide, but hit&#8217;s cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it, then,&#8221; Nelia nodded.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You can come look it over,&#8221; the man declared.
&#8220;Tight hull and tight roof. We built it ourselves.
But we&#8217;re sick of the river, and we&#8217;ll sell cheap, right
here.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The three went down to the boat, and Nelia handed
him seventy-five dollars in bills. He and his partner,
who came down from the town a few minutes later,
packed up their personal property in two trunks.
They left the dishes and other outfit, including several
blankets.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The four talked as the two packed up. One of them
suddenly looked sharply at Nelia:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You dropping down alone?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She hesitated, and then laughed:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of my business,&#8221; the man said, doubtfully,
&#8220;but it&#8217;s a mean old river, some ways. A lady alone
might get into trouble. River pirates, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was a challenge. He was a clear-eyed, honest man,
hardly twenty-five years of age, and not an evil type
at all. What he had to suggest he did boldly, sure of
his right at such a time, under such circumstances, to
do. He was entirely likeable. In spite of herself, Nelia
wavered for a moment. She knew river people; the
woman by her side would have said she would be safer
with him than without his protection. There was only
one reason why Nelia could not accept that protection.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to take care of myself,&#8221; she shook her head,
without rebuke to the youth. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;m running
away from a mean scoundrel.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s so,&#8221; the river woman approved, and the men
took their departure without further comment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The two women, disapproving the men&#8217;s housekeeping,
scrubbed the boat and washed all the bedding.
Nelia brought down her automobile and the two carried
her own outfit on board. Then Nelia took the car
back to the garage, and said that she would call for
it in the morning.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;All right, Mrs. Carline,&#8221; the garage man replied,
without suspicion.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Back at the landing, Nelia bade the river woman
good-bye.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I got to be going,&#8221; she said, &#8220;likely there&#8217;ll be a

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Got a gun?&#8221; the woman asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Two,&#8221; Nelia smiled. &#8220;Bill gave me a goose rifle

to the sense of freedom and independence which she
now had.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Stillness, peace, the sense of vast motion in the river
torrent comforted her. The moment of embarking
alone on the river had been full of nervous tenseness
and anxiety, but now those feelings were left behind
and she could breathe deeply and confront the future
with a calm spirit. The veil that the blue mist of distance
left behind her was penetrable by memory, but
the future was hidden from her gaze, as it was hidden
from her imagination.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In mid-afternoon, the man who had so desperately
and as a last resource tested the efficiency
of moonshine whiskey as a palliative for mental
misery awaked gradually, in confusion of mind and
aching of body. Noises filled his ears, and streaking
lights blurred the keenness of his eyes. Reason had
but little to do with his first thoughts, and feelings had
nearly everything. There did not seem to be any
possible atonement for him to make. Too late, as it
seemed, he realized the enormity of his offence and the
bitterness of inevitable punishment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There remained but one thing for him to do, and that
was go away down the rivers and find the fugitive
Jock Drones, whose mother feared for him. No other
usefulness of purpose remained in his reach. If he
stood up, now, before any congregation, the imps of
Satan, the patrons of moonshiners, would leer up at
him in his pulpit, reminding him that he, too, was one
of them.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He went over to the corner of his cabin, raised some
planks there and dug down into the earth till he found
a jug. He dragged the jug into the cabin and out of
it poured the Rasba patrimony, a hidden treasure of
gold, which he put into a leather money belt and strapped
on. There was not much in the cabin worth taking
away, but he packed that little up and made ready for
his departure.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was but a few miles over to Tug River, and he
readily engaged a wagon to carry him that far. On
the wooded river bank he built a flatboat with his own
hands, and covered one end of it with a poplar-wood
cabin, purchased at a near-by sawmill. He floated out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
of the eddy in his shack-boat and began his journey
down the rivers to the Mississippi, where he would
perform the one task that remained for him to do in
the service of God. He would find Jock, give him his
mother&#8217;s message, and after that expiate his own sins
in the deserved misery of an exiled penitent.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Tug River was in flood, a heavy storm having cast
nearly two inches of rainfall upon part of the watershed.
On the crest of the flood it was fast running
and there was no delay, no stopping between dawn and
dusk. Standing all day at the sweeps Rasba cleared
the shore in sharp bends, avoided the obstacles in mid
stream, and outran the wave crests and the racing drift,
entering the Big Sandy and emerging into the unimaginable
breadths of the Ohio.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had no time to waste on the Ohio. The object
of his search was on the Mississippi, hundreds of miles
farther down, and he could not go fast enough to suit
him. But at that, pulling nervously at his sweeps
and riding down the channel line, he &#8220;gain-speeded,&#8221;
till his eyes were smarting with the fury of the changing
shores, and his arms were aching with the pulling and
pushing of his great oars, and he neither recognized the
miles that he floated nor the repeated days that ensued.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Long since he had escaped from his own mountain
environment. The trees no longer overhung his
course; railroad trains screamed along endless shores,
bridges overhung his path like menacing deadfalls, and
the rolling thunder of summer storms was mingled
with the black smoke of ten thousand undreamed-of
industries. The simplicity of the mountain cornfields
of his youth had become a mystery of production, of
activity, of passing phenomena which he neither knew
nor understood. In his thoughts there was but one
beacon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His purpose was to reach the Mississippi, take the
young man in hand, and redeem him from the evils
into which he had fallen. His object was no more than
that, nor any less. From the confusion of his experiences,
efforts, and humiliations, he held fast to one fact:
the necessity of finding Jock Drones. All things else
had melted into that.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The river banks fell apart along his course; the river
ridges withdrew to wide distances, even blue at times;
mere V-gullies or U-gorges, widened into vast corn
fields. A post-office store-house at a rippling ford gave
way to smoking cities, rumbling bridges, paved streets,
and hurrying throngs. The lone fisherman in an
18-foot dugout had changed insensibly to darting motorboats
and to huge, red-wheeled, white-castled monsters,
whose passage in the midst of vast waters was attended
by the sighs of toiling engines and the tossing
of troubled seas.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Except for that one sure demand upon him, Elijah
Rasba long since would have been lost in the confusion
and doubts of his transition from narrow wooded ridges
and trembling streamlets to this succession of visions.
But his soul retained its composure, his eyes their quickness
to seize the essential detail, and he rode the Tug
River freshet into the Ohio flood tide bent upon his
mission of redeeming one mountain youth who had
strayed down into this far land, of which the shores
were washed by the unimaginable sea of a river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When at the end of a day he arrived in a way-side
eddy and moored his poplar-bottom craft against a
steep bank and the last twilight had faded from his
vision, he would eat some simple thing for supper, and
then, by lamp-light, try to read his exotic life into the
Bible which accompanied him on his travels. He knew
the Book by heart, almost; he knew all the rivers told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
about in it; he knew the storms of the various biblical
seas; he knew the Jordan, in imagination, and the Nile,
the Euphrates, the Jabbok, and the Brook of Egypt,
but they did not conform in his imagination with this
living tide which was carrying him down its course,
over shoal, around bend and from vale to vale of a
size and grandeur beyond expression.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Elijah was speechless with amazement; the spies
who had gone into Canaan, holding their tongues, and
befriended by women whose character Elijah Rasba
could not identify, were less surprised by the riches
which they discovered than Rasba by the panorama
which he saw rolled out for his inspection day by day.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Other shanty-boaters were dropping down before
the approach of winter. Sometimes one or another
would drift near to Rasba&#8217;s boat and there would be an
exchange of commonplaces.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;How fur mout hit be, strangeh?&#8221; he would ask each
man. &#8220;&#8217;Low hit&#8217;s a hundred mile yet to the Mississippi?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A hundred miles! They could not understand that
this term in the mountain man&#8217;s mind meant &#8220;a long
ways,&#8221; if need be a thousand or ten thousand miles.
When one answered that the Mississippi was 670 miles,
and another said it was a &#8220;month&#8217;s floating,&#8221; their
replies were equally without meaning to his mind.
Rasba could not understand them when they talked
of reaches, crossings, wing dams, government works,
and chutes and islands, but he would not offend any
of them by showing that he did not in the least understand
what they were talking about. He must never
again hurt the feelings of any man or woman, and he
must perform the one service which the Deity had left
for him to perform.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Little by little he began to understand that he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
approaching the Mississippi River. He saw the Cumberland
one day, and two hours later, he was witness to
the Tennessee, and that long, wonderful bridge which a
railroad has flung from shore to shore of the great river.
The current carried him down to it, and his face turned
up and up till he was swept beneath that monument to
man&#8217;s inspiration and the industry of countless hands.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba had seen cities and railroads and steamboats,
but all in a kind of confusion and tumult. They had
meant but incidents down the river; this bridge, however,
a structure of huge proportions, was clearly one
piece, one great idea fixed in steel and stone.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;How big was the man who built that bridge?&#8221;
he asked himself.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>While yet the question echoed in his expanding soul
he hailed a passing skiff:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Strangeh! How fur now is it to the Mississippi
River?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Theh &#8217;tis!&#8221; the man cried, pointing down the current.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Those first free days on the Mississippi River
revealed to Nelia Crele a woman she had never
known before. Daring, fearless, making no
reckoning, she despised the past and tripped eagerly
into the future. It was no business of any one what
she did. She had married a man who had turned out
to be a scoundrel, and when fate treated her so, she
owed nothing to any one or to anything. Even the fortune
which she had easily seized through the alcoholic
imbecility of her semblance of a man brought no gratitude
to her. The money simply insured her against
poverty and her first concern was to put that money
where it would be safe from raiders and sure to bring
her an income. This, watchfulness and alertness of
mind had informed her, was the function of money.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She dropped into Cape Girardeau, and sought a
man whom she had met at her husband&#8217;s house. This
was Duneau Menard, who had little interest in the
Carlines, but who would be a safe counsellor for Nelia
Crele. He greeted her with astonishment, and smiles,
and told her what she needed to know.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I was just thinking of you, Nelia,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Carline&#8217;s
sure raising a ruction trying to find you. He &#8217;lows you
are with some man who needs slow killing. He telephoned
to me, and he&#8217;s notified a hundred sheriffs, but,
shucks! he&#8217;s a mean scoundrel, and I&#8217;m glad to see yo&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I want to have you help me invest some money,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s mine, and he signed every paper, for
me. Here&#8217;s one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He took the sheet and read:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:0.0em; '>I want my wife to share up with me all my fortune, and I hereby
convey to her stocks, bonds, and cash, according to enclosed signed
certificates, etc.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;How come hit?&#8221; the man asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He was right friendly, then,&#8221; she replied, grimly.
&#8220;For what you-all said about the daughter of my mother
I come here to claim your help. You know about
money, about interest and dividends. I want it so I
can have money, regular, like Gus did&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I shall be glad to fix that,&#8221; he said, wiping his
glasses. &#8220;What you wish is a diversified set of investments.
How much is there?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She stacked up before him wads, rolls, briquettes,
and bundles. He counted it, slip by slip and when
he had completed the tally and reckoned some figures
on the back of an envelope, he nodded his approval.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I expect that this will bring you around twelve or
fifteen hundred dollars a year, safe, and a leetle besides,
on speculation.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; she said, approvingly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No one in town connected her with the sensation up
around Gage. She was just one of those shanty-boat
girls who come down the Mississippi every once in a
while, especially below St. Louis. In a hundred cities
and towns people were looking for Mrs. Augustus
Carline, supposed to be cutting a dashing figure, and
probably in company with a certain Dick Asunder,
who had been seen in Chester, with his big black automobile
on the same day that Mrs. Carline abandoned
her husband&#8217;s automobile there.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Of course, the shanty-boaters did not tell, if they
knew; the River tells no tales. Certainly, of all the
women in the world this casual visitor at Attorney
Menard&#8217;s need not attract attention. Menard always
did have strange clients, and it was nothing new to
see a shanty-boat land in and some man or woman
walk up to his corner office and sit down to tell him
in legal confidences things more interesting to know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
than any one not of his curiosity and sympathy would
ever dream.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Attorney Menard kept faith with river wastrels,
floating nomads who are akin to gypsies, but who are of
all bloods&mdash;tramps of the running floods. He listened
to narratives stranger than any other attorney; in his
safe he had documents of interest to sweethearts and
wives, to husbands and sons, to fugitives and hunters.
Letters came to him from all parts of the great basin, giving
him directions, or notifying him of the termination
of lives whose passing had a significance or a meaning.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia&#8217;s mother knew him, and Nelia herself recalled
his good-humoured smile, his weathered face, his appeal
to a girl for her confidence, and the certainty that her
confidence would be respected. She had gone to him
as naturally as she would have gone to a decent father
or a wise mother. She took from him his neatly written
receipt, but with the feeling that it was superfluous.
In a little while she returned to the shanty-boat and
dropped out of the eddy on her way down the river.
She floated under the big Thebes Bridge, and landed
against the west bank before dark, there to have the
luck to shoot a wild goose. The maps showed that
she was approaching the Lower Mississippi.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When she had left Cape Girardeau, she had noticed
a little brick-red shanty-boat which landed in just below
her own. Without looking up, she discovered that a
man leaned against the roof of his low cabin whose eyes
did not cease to watch her every motion while she
cast off, coiled her ropes, and leaned to the light sweeps.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When she was a safe distance down the river, she
ventured to look up stream, and saw that the little red
shanty-boat had left its mooring, and that the man was
coming down the current astern of her. It was a free
river; any one could go whither he pleased, but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
certainty that she had attracted the man&#8217;s attention revealed
to her the necessity of considering her position
there alone and dependent on her own resources.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She remembered the two market hunters, and their
warnings. The man astern was a patient, lurking,
menacing brute, who might suspect her of having property
enough to make a river piracy worth while; or he
might have other designs, since she was unfortunately
good-looking and attractive. Night would surely be
his opportunity and the test of her soul.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She could have landed at Commerce, where there
were several shanty-boats and temporary safety; she
could have floated on down at night and slipped into the
shore in the dark, her lights out; she could have tried
flight down the river hoping to lose the brick-red boat;
she decided against all these.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Boldly she pulled into an eddy just before sunset,
and had made fast to a snag and a live root when the
little boat came dropping down in the edge of the current
hardly forty feet distant, with the man leaning
on his sweeps, watching her every motion, especially
fastening his gaze upon her trim figure.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As he came opposite she turned and faced him; her
jaws set.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hello, girlie!&#8221; he called, leaning upon his sweeps
to carry his skiff-like boat into the same eddy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>On the instant she snatched the automatic pistol from
her bosom and, dropping the muzzle, fired. The man
stumbled back with a cry. He stood grabbing at his
shoulder, his florid face turning white, his eyes starting
with terror and pain. She saw him reel and fall through
the open hatch of his cabin and his boat go drifting
on into the crossing below. It occurred to her
numbed brain that she was delivered from that peril,
but as dusk fell she hated the misery of her loneliness.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The Ohio had the Mississippi eddied. The
rains that had fallen over the valleys of Kentucky
and southern Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois
had brought a tide down the big branch and as there
was not much water running out of the Missouri and
Upper Mississippi, the flood had backed up the Mississippi
for a little while, stopping the current almost
dead.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Elijah Rasba, running full tilt in the mid Ohio current,
looked ahead that afternoon, and he had a full view of
the thing to which he had come, seeking the wandering
son of Mrs. Drones.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He arrived at the moment when the Mississippi,
having been banked up long enough, began to feel the
restraint of the Ohio and resent it. The gathered
waters moved down against the Ohio flood and pressed
them back against the Kentucky side. Once more the
Mississippi River resumed its sway. On the loosed
waters was a little cigar-box of a shanty-boat, and Rasba
rowed toward it across the saucer-like sucks and depressions
where the two currents of different speeds
dragged by each other.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He pulled alongside, hailed, and, for answer, heard a
groan, a weak cry:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Help!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He carried a line across to the stranger&#8217;s deck and
made it fast. Then he saw, stretched upon the floor,
a stricken man, from whose side a pool of blood had
run. Working rapidly, Elijah discovered the wound
and as gunshot injuries were only too familiar in his
mountain experience he well knew what he should do.
Examination showed that it was a painful and dangerous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
shoulder shot. He cleared away the stains, washed
the hole, plucked the threads of cloth out of it, turned
the man on his face and, with two quick slashes of a
razor, cut out the missile which had done the injury.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Healing liniment, the inevitable concoction of a
mountaineer&#8217;s cabin, soothed while it dressed the
wound. Pads of cotton, and a bandage supplied
the final need, and Rasba stretched his patient upon
the cabin-boat bunk, then looked out upon the world
to which he had drifted.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was still a vast river, coming from the unknown
and departing into the unknown. He knew it must be
the Mississippi, but he acknowledged it with difficulty.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He did not ask the man about the bullet. Born
and bred in the mountains, he knew that that would be
an unpardonable breach of etiquette. But the wounded
man was uneasy, and when he was eased of his pain,
he began to talk:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I wa&#8217;nt doin&#8217; nothing!&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I were jes&#8217;
drappin&#8217; down, up above Buffalo Island, an&#8217; b&#8217;low
Commerce, an&#8217; a lady shot me&mdash;bang! Ho law! She
jes&#8217; shot me thataway. No &#8217;count for hit at all.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A lady you knowed?&#8221; Rasba asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No suh! But she&#8217;s onto the riveh, into a shanty-boat,
purty, too, an&#8217; jes&#8217; drappin&#8217; down, like she wa&#8217;nt
goin&#8217; no wheres, an&#8217; like she mout of be&#8217;n jes&#8217; moseyin&#8217;.
I jes &#8217;lowed I&#8217;d drap in, an&#8217; say howdy like, an&#8217; she
drawed down an&#8217; shot&mdash;bang!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Was she frightened?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit were a lonesome reach, along of Powerses
Island,&#8221; the man admitted, whining and reluctant.
&#8220;She didn&#8217;t own that there riveh. Hain&#8217;t a man no
right to land in anywheres? She shot me jes&#8217; like I was
a dawg, an&#8217; she hadn&#8217;t no feelin&#8217;s nohow. Jes&#8217; like a

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Did you know her?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, suh. We&#8217;d be&#8217;n drappin&#8217; down, an&#8217; drappin&#8217;

friendly? An&#8217; theh she ups an&#8217; shoots me like a dawg.
She&#8217;s mean, that woman, mean an&#8217; pretty, too, like some
women is!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba wondered. He had been long enough on the
Ohio to get the feeling of a great river. He saw the
specious pleading of the wounded wretch, and his quick
imagination pictured the woman alone in a vast, wild
wood, at the edge of that running mile-wide flood.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Of co&#8217;rse!&#8221; he said, half aloud, &#8220;of co&#8217;rse!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Co&#8217;rse what?&#8221; the man demanded, querulously.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Co&#8217;rse she shot,&#8221; Rasba answered, tartly. &#8220;Sometimes
a lady jes&#8217; naturaly has to shoot, fearin&#8217; of men.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba landed the two boats in at the foot of a sandbar,
and made them fast to old stakes driven into the
top of the low reef. He brought his patient some hot
soup, and after they had eaten supper, he sat down to
talk to him, keeping the man company in his pain, and
leading him on to talk about the river, and the river
people.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In that first adventure at the Ohio&#8217;s forks Rasba had
discovered his own misconceptions, and the truth of the
Mississippi had been partly revealed to him. What the
Tug was to the Big Sandy, what the Big Sandy was to
the Ohio, the Ohio was to the Mississippi. What
he had looked to as the end was but the beginning, and
Rasba was lost in the immensity of the river that was a
mile wide, thousands of miles long, and unlike anything
the mountain preacher had ever dreamed of. If
this was the Mississippi, what must the Jordan be?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Prebol,&#8221; the man said, &#8220;Jest Prebol.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>

I am&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A grafter?&#8221; Rasba repeated the strange word.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh, cyards, an&#8217; tradin&#8217; slum, barberin&#8217; mebby,
an&#8217; mebby some otheh things. I can sell patent medicine
to a doctor, I can! I clean cisterns, an&#8217; anything.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You gamble?&#8221; Rasba demanded, grasping one
fact.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; Prebol grinned. &#8220;Who all mout <i>yo&#8217;</i> be?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Elijah Rasba,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I am seeking a
soul lost from the sheepfold of God. I ask but the
strength to find him.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A parson?&#8221; Prebol asked, doubtfully, his eyes resting
a little in their uneasy flickerings. &#8220;One of them
missionaries?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, suh.&#8221; Rasba shook his head, humbly. &#8220;Jes&#8217;
a mountang parson, lookin&#8217; for one po&#8217;r man, low
enough fo&#8217; me to he&#8217;p, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Prebol made no reply or comment. His mind was
grappling with a fact and a condition. He could not
tell what he thought. He remembered with some worriment,
that he had cursed under the pain of the dressing
of the wound. He knew that it never brought any
man good luck to swear within ear-range of any parson.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He could think of nothing to do, just then, so he
pretended weariness, which was not all pretense, at
that. Rasba left him to go to sleep on his cot, and went
over to his own boat, where, after an audible session
on his knees, he went to bed, and fell into a sound and
dreamless sleep.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In the morning, when the parson awakened, his first
thought was of his patient, and he started out to look
after the man. He looked at the face of the sandbar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
reef against which the little red shanty-boat had been
moored. The boat was gone!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba, studying the hard sand, soon found the prints
of bare feet, and he knew that Prebol had taken his
departure precipitately, but the reason why was not so
apparent to the man who had read many a wild turkey
track, deer runway, and trails of other game.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>From sun-up till nearly noon, while he made and ate
his breakfast, and while he turned to the Scriptures
for some hint as to this river man&#8217;s mind, his thoughts
turned again and again to the pictures which Prebol&#8217;s
tales, boastings, whinings, and condition had inspired.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He felt his own isolation, strangeness, and ignorance.
He could not understand the man who had fled from assistance
and succour; at the same time the liveliness of
his fancy reverted again and again to the woman living
alone in such a desolation, shooting whoever menaced.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>That type was not new to him. Up in his own country
he had known of women who had stood at their
rifles, returning shot for shot of feud raiders. The
pathetic courage of the woman who had shot Prebol
appealed to him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The wounded man, wicked beyond measure, and the
woman assailed, he realized, were like hundreds of
other men and women whose shanty-boats he had
seen down the Ohio River, and which lurked in bends
and reaches on both sides of the Mississippi.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Give thyself no rest!&#8221; he read, and he obeyed. He
believed that he had a black sin to expiate, and he
dared not begin what his soul was hungering to do, because
knowing wickedness, he had deliberately sinned.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Alternately, he read his Bible and prayed. Late in
the day he dropped out of the eddy and floated on down.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I &#8217;low I can keep on huntin&#8217; for Jock Drones,&#8221; he
told himself. &#8220;I shore can do that, yes, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Having rid herself of the leering river rat, Nelia
Crele trembled for a time in weak dismay,
the reaction from her tense and fiery determination
to protect herself at all costs. But she quickly
gathered her strength and, having brewed a pot of
strong coffee, thrown together a light supper, and settled
back in her small, but ample, rocking chair, she reviewed
the incidents of her adventure; the flight from her worthless
husband and her assumption of the right to protect
herself.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>After all, shooting a man was less than running away
from her husband. She could regard the matter with
a rather calm spirit and even a laughing scorn of the
man who had thought to impose himself on her, against
her own will.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; she said, half aloud, &#8220;I needn&#8217;t to allow
any man to be mean to me!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She had given her future but little thought; now she
wondered, and she pondered. She was free, she was
independent, and she was assured of her living. She
had even been more shrewd than old Attorney Menard
had suspected; the money she had left with him was
hardly half of her resources. She had another plan,
by which she would escape the remote possibility of
Menard&#8217;s proving faithless to his trust, as attorneys
with his opportunities sometimes have proved.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia Crele could not possibly be regarded as an ordinary
woman, as a mere commonplace, shack-bred,
pretty girl. Down through the years had come a
strain of effectiveness which she inherited in its full
strength; she was as inexplicable as Abraham Lincoln.
Her stress of mind relieved, she regarded the shooting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
of the man with increasing satisfaction, since by such
things a woman could be assured of respect.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Gaiety had never been a part of her childhood or
girlhood; she had withstood the insidious attacks and
menaces that threatened her down to the day when
Gus Carline had come to her. Courted by him, married,
and then living in the clammy splendour of the
house of a back-country rich man, she had found no
happiness, but merely a kind of animal comfort. She
had had the Carline library to read, and she had brought
with her the handy pocket volumes which had been her
own and her delight. She was glad of the foresight
which enabled her to put into a set of book shelves the
companions which had, alone, been her comfort and
inspiration during the few years of her wedded misery.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Now, on the Mississippi, in the shanty-boat, she need
consult only her own fancy and whim. Mistress of
her own affairs, as she supposed, she could read or she
could think.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I do what I please!&#8221; she thought, a little defiantly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s business what I do now; what&#8217;d Mrs.
Plosell care what people said about her? I&#8217;ll read, if
I want to, and I&#8217;ll flirt if I want to&mdash;and I&#8217;ll do anything
I want to&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She reckoned without the Mississippi. Everybody
does, at first. Her money was but a means to an end.
She knew its use, its value, and the perfect freedom which
it gave her; its protection was not underestimated.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>At the same time, sloth was no sin of hers. Living
on the river insured physical activity; her books insured
her mental engagement.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She had lived so many years in combat with grim
necessity that the lesson of thrift of all her resources
had been brought home to her. Having been waylaid
by circumstance so often, she took grim care now to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
count the costs, and to insure her getting what she was
seeking. The trouble was she could not disassociate
her feelings from her ideas. They were inextricably
interwoven. The brief years of her wedlock had been
in one way a disillusionment, in another a revelation.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She had found her own hunger for learning, her own
strength and weakness, and while she had lost to the
Widow Plosell, she had clearly seen that it was not her
fault but Gus Carline&#8217;s meagreness of mind and shallowness
of soul. Instead of losing her confidence, she had
found her own ability.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For hours she debated there by her pretty lamp, with
the curtains down, and the comforting and reassuring
weight of the automatic pistol in her lap. She knew
that she must never have that weapon at arm&#8217;s length
from her, but as she remembered where it had come
from she wondered to think that she had so easily
refused the suggestion of Frank, the market hunter.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, though,&#8221; she shrugged her shoulders,
&#8220;I can take care of myself, and being alone, I can think
things out!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In mid-morning she cut loose from the bank and
floated away down stream. The river was very wide,
and covered with crossing-ripples. She looked down
what the map showed was the chute of Hacker Tow
Head, and then the current carried her almost to the
bank at the head of Buffalo Island.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Here there was a stretch of caving bank; the earth,
undercut by the river current, was lumping off in
chunks and slices. Her boat bobbed and danced in
the waves from the cave-ins, and the rocking pleased
her fancy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The names along this bit of river awakened her interest;
Blackbird Island was clearly described: Buffalo
Island harked back many years into tradition; Dogtooth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
Island was a matter of river shape; but Saladin,
Tow Head and Orient Field stirred her imagination,
for they might reveal the scene of steamboat disasters
or some surveyor&#8217;s memory of the Arabian Nights.
Below Dogtooth Island, under Brooks Point, were a
number of golden sandbars and farther down, in the
lower curve of the famous S-bends she read the name
&#8220;Greenleaf,&#8221; which was pretty and picturesque.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She was living! Every minute called upon some resource
of her brain. She had read in old books things
which gave even the name Cairo, at the foot of the long,
last reach of the Upper Mississippi, a significance of
far lands and Egyptian mysteries. Gratefully she understood
that the Mississippi was summoning ideals
which ought to have been called upon long since when
in the longings of her girlhood she had been circumspect
and patient, keeping her soul satisfied with dreams of
fairies playing among the petals of hill-side flowers, or
gnomes wandering among the stalks of toll-yielding
cornfields.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Mature, now; fearless&mdash;and, as the word romped
through her mind in all its changes, free&mdash;free!&mdash;she
played with her thoughts. But below Greenleaf
Bend, as another day was lost in waning evening, she
early sought a sandbar mooring at the foot of Missouri
Sister Island, where there were two other shanty-boats,
one of them with two children on the sand. She need
not dread a boat where children were found. Possibly
she would be able to talk to another woman, which
would be a welcome change, having had so much of her
own thoughts!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>This other woman was Mrs. Disbon, out of the Missouri.
She and her husband had been five years coming
down from the Yellowstone, and they had fished,
trapped, and enjoyed themselves in their 35-foot cabin-boat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
home. Of course, taking care of two children on a
shanty-boat was a good deal of work and some worry, for
one or the other was always falling overboard, but
since they had learned to swim it hadn&#8217;t been so bad,
and they could take care of themselves.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You all alone?&#8221; Mrs. Disbon asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m alone,&#8221; Nelia admitted, having told her name
as Nelia Crele.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know as I blame you,&#8221; Mrs. Disbon
declared, looking at her husband doubtfully. &#8220;Seems
to me that on the average, men are more of a nuisance
than they&#8217;re worth. It&#8217;s which and t&#8217;other about
them. I see you&#8217;ve had experience?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia looked down at her wedding ring.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve had experience,&#8221; she nodded.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Going clear down?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You mean&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;N&#8217;Orleans?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, I hadn&#8217;t thought much about it.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;The Lower River&#8217;s pretty bad.&#8221; Disbon looked up
from cleaning his repeating shotgun. &#8220;My first trip
was out of the Ohio and down to N&#8217;Orleans. I wouldn&#8217;t
recommend to no woman that she go down thataway,
not alone. Theh&#8217;s junker-pirates use up from N&#8217;Orleans,
and, course, there&#8217;s always more or less meanness
below Cairo. Above St. Louis it ain&#8217;t so bad, but mean
men draps down from Little Klondike.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t made up my mind,&#8221; Nelia said, adding,
with a touch of bitterness, &#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon it makes so
much difference!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Lots that comes down feel thataway,&#8221; Mrs. Disbon
nodded, with sympathy, &#8220;Seems like some has
more&#8217;n their share, and some considerable less!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia remained there three days, for there was good
company, and a two-day rain had set in between midnight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
and dawn on the following morning. There
was no hurry, and she was going nowhere. She had
the whole family over to supper the second night, and
she ate two meals or so with them.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The other shanty-boat, about a hundred yards down
stream, was an old man&#8217;s. He had a soldier&#8217;s pension,
and he lived in serene restfulness, reading General
Grant&#8217;s memoirs, and poring over the documents of
the Rebellion, discovering points of military interest
and renewing his own memories of his part in thirty-odd
battles with Grant before Vicksburg and down the
line with the Army of the Potomac.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia could have remained there indefinitely, but
restlessness was in her mind, as long as she had so much
money on board her little shanty-boat. Disbon knew
so many tales of river piracy that she saw the wisdom
of settling her possessions, either at Cairo or Memphis,
whichever should prove best.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Landing against the bank just above the ferry, she
walked over to Cairo and sought for a man who had
hired her father to help him hunt for wild turkeys.
He was a banker, and would certainly be the right kind
of a man to help her, if he would.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Mr. Brankeau,&#8221; she addressed him in his office, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know if you remember me, but you came hunting
to the River Bottoms below St. Genevieve, one time,
and you and Father went over into Missouri, hunting
turkeys.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He was white as that?&#8221; Brankeau exclaimed, astonished
at the paper Carline had signed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He was that white,&#8221; she replied, her eyes narrowing.
Brankeau from the wideness of his experience, laughed.
She, an instant later, laughed, too.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;So you settled the question between you?&#8221; he suggested,
&#8220;I thought from the newspapers he hadn&#8217;t
suspicioned&mdash;this paper&mdash;um-m!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a forgery, Mr. Brankeau,&#8221; she assured him.
&#8220;He was one of those gay sports, you know, and, for a
change, he sported around with me, once. I came away
between days. You know his failing.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Several of them, especially drink,&#8221; the man nodded

fled.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He caught up his top-coat and hat, but he went to
the Ohio River, instead of to the Mississippi, where

into The Forks.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She sat on the bow deck of her boat, looking at the

the tawny Missouri flood.</p>

downward and she was startled to see her wedding ring,
with its guard ring, still on her left hand; it had never
been off since the day her husband placed it there.</p>

with sustained calmness, removed the thin guard, and
slipped the ring from its place. She put it upon the

the guard was not necessary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A whisper, that became a rumour, which became
a report, reached Gage and found the
ears of Augustus Carline, whose wife had disappeared
sometime previously. After two wild days
of drinking Carline suddenly sobered up when the
fact became assured that Nelia had gone and really
meant to remain away, perhaps forever.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The thing that startled him into certainty was the
paper which he found signed by himself, at the bank.
He had forgotten all about signing the papers that night
when Nelia had shown herself to be the gayest sport of
them all. Now he found that he had signed away his
stocks and bonds, and that he had given over his cash
account.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The amount was startling enough, but it did not include
his real estate, of which about two thirds of his
fortune had been composed. If it had been all stocks
and bonds, he thought he would have been left with
nothing. He considered himself at once fortunate and
unlucky.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I never knew the old girl was as lively as that!&#8221; he
told himself, and having tasted a feast, he could not
regard the Widow Plosell as more than a lunch, and
a light lunch, at that.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia had been easily traced to Chester. Beyond
Chester the trail seemed to indicate that Dick Asunder
had eloped with her, but ten days later Asunder returned
home with a bride whom he had married in
St. Louis.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Beyond Chester Nelia had left no trace, and there
was nothing even to indicate whether she had taken
the river steamer, the railroad train, or gone into flight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
with someone who was unknown and unsuspected.
When Carline, sobered and regretful, began to make
searching inquiries, he learned that there were a score,
or half a hundred men for whom Old Crele had acted
as a hunter&#8217;s and fisher&#8217;s guide. These sportsmen had
come from far and wide during many years, and both
Crele and her wistful mother admitted that many of
them had shown signs of interest and even indications
of affection for the girl as a child and as a pretty maid,
daughter of a poor old ne&#8217;er-do-well.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But she was good,&#8221; Carline cried. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t she
tell you she was going&mdash;or where she&#8217;d go?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Never a word!&#8221; the two denied.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But where would she go?&#8221; the frantic husband demanded.
&#8220;Did she never talk about going anywhere?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well-l,&#8221; Old Crele meditated, &#8220;peahs like she used
to go down an&#8217; watch Ole Mississip&#8217; a heap. What&#8217;d
she use to say, Old Woman? I disremember, I &#8217;clar
I do.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, she was always wishing she knowed where all
that river come from an&#8217; where all it&#8217;d be goin&#8217; to,&#8221;
Mrs. Crele at last recollected.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But she wouldn&#8217;t dare&mdash;She wouldn&#8217;t go
alone?&#8221; Carline choked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Prob&#8217;ly not, a gal favoured like her,&#8221; Old Crele
admitted, without shame. &#8220;I &#8217;low if she was a-picking,
she&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; had the pick.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Cold rage alternated with hot fear in the mind of
Gus Carline. If she had gone alone, he might yet overtake
her; on the other hand, if she had gone with some
man, he was in honour bound to kill that man. He was
sensitive, now, on points of honour. The Widow Plosell,
having succeeded in creating a favourable condition,
from her viewpoint, sought to take advantage of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
She was, however, obliged to go seeking her recent admirer,
only to discover that he blamed her&mdash;as men do&mdash;for
his trouble. She consulted a lawyer to see if she
could not obtain financial redress for her unhappy position,
only to learn of her own financial danger should
Mrs. Carline determine upon legal revenge.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Carline, between trying to convince himself that he
was the victim of fate and the innocent sufferer from a
domestic tragedy brought upon himself by events over
which he had no control, fell to hating liquor as the
chief cause of his discomfiture.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then a whisper that became a rumour, which at
last seemed to be a fact, said that Nelia Carline was
somewhere down Old Mississip&#8217;. Someone who knew
her by sight was reported to have seen her in Cape
Girardeau, and the husband raced down there in his
automobile to see if he could not learn something about
the missing woman, whose absence now proved what a
place she had filled in his heart.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There was no doubt of it. Nelia had been there,
but no one had happened to think to tell Carline about
it. She had landed in a pretty shanty-boat, the wharf-master
said, and had pulled out just before a river man
in a brick-red cabin-boat of small size had left the eddy.
The river man had dropped in just behind her, and,
according to the wharf-master:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I shore kept my eyes on that man, for he was a
riveh rat!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The thought was sickening to Carline. His wife
floating down the river with a river rat close behind
presented but two explanations: she was being followed
for crime, or the two were just flirting on the river,
together.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He bought a pretty 28-foot motorboat, 22-inch draft
with a 7-foot beam and a raised deck cabin. Having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
stocked up with supplies, he started down the Ohio to
find his woman.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He could not tell what his intention was, not even to
himself; his mind, long weakened and depraved by
liquor, lacked clarity of thought and distinctiveness of
purpose. One hour he raged with anger, and murder
blackened his heart; another minute, his shattered
nerves left him in a panic of fears and remorse, and he
hoped for nothing better than to beg his wife and sweetheart
for forgiveness. At all times dread of what he
might find at the end of the trail tormented him from
terror to despair.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His anguish overcame all his other sensations. It
even overcame his lust for liquor. He grew sturdier
under his affliction, so that when he arrived at Cairo,
and swung his craft smartly up to the wharf-boat, his
eyes were clear and his skin was honestly coloured by
sunshine and pure winds. Here fortune favoured him
with more news of his wife. The engineer of the Cairo-Missouri
ferryboat had seen a young and pretty woman
moored at the bank some distance from the landing.
She had remained there upward of a week, having no
visitors, and making daily visits over the levee into the
little city.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;One day she stood there, I bet half an hour, looking
back, like she was waiting,&#8221; the engineer said. &#8220;I
seen her onto the levee top. Then she come down,
jumped aboard with her lines, an&#8217; pulled out to go on
trippin&#8217; down. I wondered then wouldn&#8217;t some man be
following of her.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When Carline passed below the sandbar point, at
which the Ohio and Mississippi mingle their waters,
and the human flotsam from ten thousand towns is
caught by swirling eddies, he found himself subdued
by a shadow that fell athwart his course, dulling the fire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
of his own spirit with a doubt and an awe which he had
never before known.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His wife had gone past the Jumping Off Place; he
had heard a thousand jests about that fork of the
rivers, without comprehending its deeper meaning, till
in his own experience he, too, was flung down the tide
by forces now beyond his control, though he himself
had set them in motion. His suffering was no less
acute, his mind was no less active, but it dawned
slowly on him that, after all, the acute pain which was
in his heart was no greater than the sorrow, the suffering,
the poisoned deliriums of the thousands who had
given themselves to this mighty flood, which was so vast
and powerful that it dwarfed the senses of mortals to
a feeling of the proper proportion of their affairs in the
workings of the universe.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Insensibly, but surely, his pride began to fade and
his selfishness began to give way to better understanding
and kindlier counsels. That much the River Spirit
had done for him. He would not give up the search,
but rather would he increase its thoroughness, and redouble
his efforts. But he would never again be quite
without sympathy, quite without understanding of
sensations and experiences which were not of his own
heart and soul.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The river was a mile wide; its current surged from
the deeps; it flowed down the bend and along the reach
with a noiselessness, a resistlessness, a magnitude that
seemed to carry him out of his whole previous existence&mdash;and
so it did carry him. Still human, still
finite, prone to error and lack of comprehension,
nevertheless Augustus Carline entered for the moment
upon a new life recklessly and willingly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For a minute Elijah Rasba, as the Mississippi
revealed itself to him, contemplated a greater
field for service than he had ever dreamed of.
Then, humbled in his pride at the thought of great success,
he felt that it could not be; for such an opportunity
an Apostle was needed, and Rasba&#8217;s cheeks
warmed with shame at the realization of the vanity
in his momentary thought.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He was grateful for the privilege of seeing the panorama
that unrolled and unfolded before his eyes with the
same slow dignity with which the great storm clouds
boiled up from the long backs of the mountains of his
own homeland. He missed the elevations, the clustered
wildernesses, and ledges of stone against a limited
sky, but in their places he saw the pale heavens in a
dome that was uninterrupted from horizon to horizon.
There seemed to be hardly any earth commensurate
with the sky, and the river seemed to be flowing between
bounds so low and insignificant that he felt as
though it might break through one side or the other
and fall into the chaos beyond the brim of the world.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Instinctively he removed his hat in this Cathedral.
Familiar from childhood with mountains and deep valleys,
the sense of power and motion in the river appealed
to him as the ocean might have done. He
looked about him with curiosity and inquiry. He felt
as though there must be some special meaning for him
in that immediate moment, and it was a long time before
he could quite believe that this thing which he
witnessed had continued far back beyond the memory of
men, and would continue into the unquestionable future.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He floated down stream from bend to bend, carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
along as easily as in the full run of time. He looked
over vast reaches, and hardly recognized other houseboats,
tucked in holes along the banks, as craft like his
own. The clusters of houses on points of low ridges
did net strike him as veritable villages, but places
akin to those of fairyland.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>All the rest of the day he dropped on down, not
knowing which side he should land against, and filled
with doubts as to where his duty lay. Once he caught
up his big oars and began to row toward a number of
little shanty-boats moored against a sandbar, close
down to a wooded bank, only to find that the river current
carried him away despite his most muscular endeavours,
so he accepted it as a sign that he should
not land there.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For a time Rasba thought that perhaps he had better
just let the river carry him whither it would, but upon
reflection he remembered what an old raftsman, who
had run strands of logs down Clinch and Holston, told
him about the nature of rivers:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Come a falling tide, an&#8217; she drags along the banks
and all that&#8217;s afloat keeps in the middle; but come a
fresh an&#8217; a risin&#8217; tide, an&#8217; the hoist of the water is in the
mid-stream, and what&#8217;s runnin&#8217; rolls off to one side or
the other, an&#8217; jams up into the drift piles.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The philosophy of that was, for this occasion, that
if Old Mississip&#8217; was falling, Elijah Rasba might never
get ashore, not in all the rest of his born days, unless
he stirred his boots. So catching up his sweep handles
he began to push a long stroke toward the west bank,
and his boat began to move on the river surface. Under
the two corners of his square bow appeared little swirls
and tiny ripples as he approached the bank and drifted
down in the edge of the current looking for a place to
land.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Before he knew it, a big patch of woods grew up
behind him, and when he felt the current under the
boat slacken he discovered that he had run out of the
Mississippi River and was in a narrow waterway no
larger than Tug Fork.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Where all mout I be?&#8221; he gasped, in wonderment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He saw three houseboats just below him, moored
against a sandbar, with hoop nets drying near by,
blue smoke curling out of tin pipes, and two or three
people standing by to look at the stranger.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He rowed ashore and carried out a big roped stone,
which he used as anchor; then he walked down the bar
toward the man who watched his approach with interest.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I am Elijah Rasba,&#8221; he greeted him. &#8220;I come
down out of Tug River; I am looking for Jock Drones;
he&#8217;s down thisaway, somewheres; can yo&#8217; all tell me
whichaway is the Mississippi River?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know him,&#8221; the fisherman shook his head.
&#8220;But this yeah is Wolf Island Chute; the current
caught you off of Columbus bluffs, and you drifted in
yeah; jes&#8217; keep a-floatin&#8217; an&#8217; d&#8217;rectly you&#8217;ll see Old
Mississip&#8217; down thataway.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s near night,&#8221; Rasba remarked, looking at the
sun through the trees. &#8220;I&#8217;m a stranger down thisaway;
mout I get to stay theh?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yo&#8217; can land anywhere&#8217;s,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;No
man can stop you all!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But a woman mout!&#8221; Rasba exclaimed, with sudden
humour. &#8220;Yistehd&#8217;y evenin&#8217;, up yonway, by the Ohio
River, I found a man shot through into his shanty-boat.
He said he &#8217;lowed to land along of the same eddy with a
woman, an&#8217; she shot him almost daid!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Ho law!&#8221; the fisherman cried, and another man and
three or four women drew near to hear the rest of the
narrative. &#8220;How come hit?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba stood there talking to them, a speaker to an
audience. He told of his floating down into the Mississippi,
and of his surprise at finding the river so large,
so without end. He said he kind of wanted to ask the
way of a shanty-boat, for a poor sinner must needs inquire
of those he finds in the wilderness, and he heard
a groan and a weak cry for help.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I cyard for him, and he thanked me kindly; he
said a woman had shot him when he was trying to be
friendly; a pretty woman, young and alone. Co&#8217;rse,
I washed his wound and I linimented it, and I cut the
bullet out of his back; law me, but that man swore!
Come night, an&#8217; he heard say I was a parson, he apologized

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho! Who all mout that man be, Parson?&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Ho law! Somebody done plugged Jest Prebol!&#8221;
one of the women cried out, laughing. &#8220;That scoundrel&#8217;s
be&#8217;n layin&#8217; off to git shot this long time, an&#8217; so
he&#8217;s got hit. I bet he won&#8217;t think he&#8217;s so winnin&#8217; of
purty women no more! He&#8217;s bad, that man, gamblin&#8217;
an&#8217; shootin&#8217; craps an&#8217; workin&#8217; the banks. Served him
right, yes, indeedy. But he&#8217;d shore hate to know a
parson hearn him cussin&#8217; an&#8217; swearin&#8217; around. Hit don&#8217;t
bring a gambler any luck, bein&#8217; heard swearin&#8217;, no.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Nor if any one else hears him; not if he thinks
swearin&#8217; in hisn&#8217;s heart!&#8221; Rasba shook his head gravely.
&#8220;How come hit yo&#8217; know that man?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;s used down this riveh ten-fifteen years; besides,

he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no good. I bet we hearn yo&#8217; was comin&#8217;,
Parson. Whiskey Williams said they was a Hallelujah
Singer comin&#8217; down the Ohio&mdash;said he could hear him
a mile. I bet yo&#8217; sing out loud sometimes?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s so,&#8221; Rasba admitted. &#8220;I sung right smart
comin&#8217; down the Ohio. Seems like I jest wanted to
sing, like birds in the posey time.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Prebol shore should git to a doctor, shot up thataway.
He didn&#8217;t say which lady shot him, Parson?&#8221;
a woman asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No; jes&#8217; a lady into an eddy into a lonesome bend.&#8221;
Rasba shook his head. &#8220;A purty woman, livin&#8217; alone
on this riveh. Do many do that?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Riveh ladies all do, sometimes. I tripped from
Cairo to Vicksburg into a skift once,&#8221; a tall, angular
woman said. &#8220;My man that use to be had stoled
the shanty-boat what I&#8217;d bought an&#8217; paid for with my
own money. I went up the bank at Columbus Hickories,
gettin&#8217; nuts; I come back, an&#8217; my boat was gone.
Wa&#8217;n&#8217;t I tearin&#8217; an&#8217; rearin&#8217;! Well, I hoofed hit down to
Columbus, an&#8217; I bought me a skift, count of me always
havin&#8217; some money saved up.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I bet Vicksburg&#8217;s a hundred mile!&#8221; Rasba mused.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A hundred mile!&#8221; the woman said with a guffaw.
&#8220;Hit&#8217;s six hundred an&#8217; sixty-three miles from Cairo to
Vicksburg, yes, indeed. A hundred mile! I made
hit in ten days, stoppin&#8217; along. I ketched it theh.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You found yo&#8217; man?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Shucks! Hit wa&#8217;n&#8217;t the man I wanted, hit were my
boat&mdash;a nice, reg&#8217;lar pine an&#8217; oak-frame boat. I bet
me I chucked him ovehbo&#8217;d, an&#8217; towed back up to
Memphis. Hit were a good $300 bo&#8217;t, sports built,
an&#8217; hits on the riveh yet&mdash;Dart Mitto&#8217;s got hit, junkin&#8217;.
You&#8217;ll see him down by Arkansaw Old Mouth if yo&#8217;s
trippin&#8217; right down.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I expect to,&#8221; Rasba replied, doubtfully. Never in
his life before had he talked in terms of hundreds of
miles, cities, and far rivers,</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yo&#8217;ll know that boat; he&#8217;s went an&#8217; painted hit a
sickly yeller, like a railroad station. I hate yeller!
Gimme a nice light blue or a right bright green.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hyar comes anotheh bo&#8217;t!&#8221; one of the men remarked,
and all turned to look up the chute, where a
little cabin-boat had drifted into sight.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No one was on deck, and it was apparent that the
Columbus banks had shunted the craft clear across
the river and down the chute, just as Rasba himself
had been carried. The shadow of the trees on the west
side of the chute fell across the boat and immediately
brought the tripper out of the cabin.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A shadow is a warning on wide rivers. It tells of
the nearness of a bank, or towhead, or even of a steamboat.
In mid-stream there is little need for apprehension,
but when the current carries one down into a
caving bend and close to overhanging trees or along
the edges of short, boiling eddies, it is time to get out
and look for snags and jeopardies.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Seeing the group of people on the sandbar, the journeyer,
who was a woman, took the sweeps of her boat
and began to work over to them.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit handles nice, that bo&#8217;t!&#8221; one of the fishermen
said. &#8220;Pulls jes&#8217; like a skift. Wonder who that woman
is?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen her some&#8217;rs,&#8221; the powerful, angular woman,
Mrs. Cooke, said after a time. &#8220;Them&#8217;s swell
clothes she&#8217;s got on. She&#8217;s all alone, too, an&#8217; what a
lady travels alone down yeah for I don&#8217;t know. She&#8217;s
purty enough to have a husband, I bet, if she wants one.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No.&#8221; Mrs. Caope shook her head. &#8220;She&#8217;s off&#8217;n
the riveh. Leastwise, she handles that bo&#8217;t reg&#8217;lar.
I cayn&#8217;t git to see her face, but I seen her some&#8217;rs, I bet.
I can tell a man by hisns walk half a mile.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In surprise she stared at the boat as it came nearer,
and then walked down to the edge of the bar to greet
the newcomer.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, I jes&#8217; knowed I&#8217;d seen yo&#8217; somers! How&#8217;s

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m alone,&#8221; the girl laughed, her gaze turning to look
at the others, who stood watching.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;If yo&#8217; git a good man,&#8221; Mrs. Caope philosophized,

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Very well, indeed!&#8221; Nelia laughed, clinging to the

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Jest Prebol, sore and sick with his bullet
wound, but more alarmed on account of having
sworn so much while a parson was dressing his
injury, could not sleep, and as he thought it over he
determined at last to cut loose and drop on down the
river and land in somewhere among friends, or where
he could find a doctor. But the practised hand of
Rasba had apparently left little to do, and it was superstitious
dread that worried Prebol.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So the river rat crept out on the sandbar, cast off the
lines, and with a pole in one hand, succeeded in pushing
out into the eddy where the shanty-boat drifted into
the main current. Prebol, faint and weary with his
exertions, fell upon his bunk. There in anguish,
delirious at intervals, and weak with misery, he floated
down reach, crossing, and bend, without light or signal.
In olden days that would have been suicide. Now the
river was deserted and no steamers passed him up or
down. His cabin-boat, but a rectangular shade amidst
the river shadows, drifted like a leaf or chip, with no
sound except when a coiling jet from the bottom suckled
around the corners or rippled along the sides.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The current carried him nearly six miles an hour, but
two or three times his boat ran out of the channel
and circled around in an eddy, and then dropped on
down again. Morning found him in mid-stream,
between two wooded banks, as wild as primeval wilderness,
apparently. The sun, which rose in a white mist,
struck through at last, and the soft light poured in first
on one side then on the other as the boat swirled
around. Once the squirrels barking in near-by trees
awakened the man&#8217;s dim consciousness, but a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
minutes later he was in mid-stream, making a crossing
where the river was miles wide.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He passed Hickman just before dawn, and toward
noon he dropped by New Madrid, and the slumping
of high, caving banks pounded in his ears down three
miles of changing channel. Then the boat crossed to
the other side and he lay there with eyes seared and
staring. He discovered a grave stone poised upon the
river bank, but he could not tell whether it was fancy or
fact that the ominous thing bent toward him and fell
with a splash into the river, while a wave tossed his boat
on its way. He heard a quavering whine that grew
louder until it became a shriek, and then fell away
into silence, but his senses were slow in connecting it
with one of the Tiptonville cotton gins. He heard a
voice, curiously human, and having forgotten the old
hay-burner river ferry, worried to think that he should
imagine someone was driving a mule team on the Mississippi.
For a long time he was in acute terror, because
he thought he was blind, and could not see, but to
his amazed relief he saw a river light and knew that
another night had fallen upon him, so he went to sleep
once more.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Voices awakened him. He opened his eyes, and the
surroundings were familiar. He smelled iodine, and
saw a man looking over a doctor&#8217;s case. Leaning
against the wall of the cabin-boat was a tall, slender
young man with arms folded.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;How&#8217;s he comin&#8217; Doc&#8217;?&#8221; the young man was
saying.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be all right. How long has he been this way?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know, Doc; he come down the riveh an&#8217;

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll look afteh him, Doc! Friend of ourn.&#8221;</p>

do, and about that medicine. You can read?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; Prebol muttered, feebly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;s a comin&#8217; back, Doc!&#8221; the young man cried,
starting up with interest.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well, old sport, looks like you&#8217;d got mussed up
some?&#8221; the doctor inquired.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh,&#8221; Prebol grinned, feebly, his senses curiously
clear. &#8220;Hit don&#8217;t pay none to mind a lady&#8217;s
business fo&#8217; her, no suh!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A lady shot you, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh,&#8221; Prebol whispered, sleepily, tired by the
exertion and excitement.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sleep&#8217;ll do him good,&#8221; the doctor said, and returned
to his little motorboat.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The young man went on board his own boat which
was moored just below Prebol&#8217;s. As he entered the
cabin, a burly, whiskered man looked up and said:</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Theh! That shows how much yo&#8217; don&#8217;t know
about women. Never had no woman yo&#8217; &#8217;lowed to
marry?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Huh! Catch me gittin&#8217; married&mdash;co&#8217;se not.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sonny, lemme tell yo&#8217;; hit ain&#8217;t yo&#8217;ll do the catchin&#8217;,
an&#8217; hit won&#8217;t be yo&#8217; who&#8217;ll be decidin&#8217; will yo&#8217; git married.
An&#8217; hit won&#8217;t be yo&#8217; who&#8217;ll decide how long
yo&#8217;ll stay married, no, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Peah&#8217;s like yo&#8217; got an awful grouch ag&#8217;in women,
Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I have?&#8221; Buck started up from
shuffling and throwing a book of cards. &#8220;Look&#8217;t
me. If Jest Prebol&#8217;s shot most daid by a woman,
look&#8217;t me. Do you know me&mdash;where I come from,
where the hell I&#8217;m goin&#8217;? Yo&#8217; bet you don&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve
been shanty-boatin&#8217; fifteen years, but I ain&#8217;t always
been a shanty-boater, no, I haven&#8217;t. Talk to me about
women. When I think what I&#8217;ve took from one woman&mdash;Sho!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He stared at the floor, his teeth clenched and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
strong face set. Slip stared. His pal had disclosed a
new phase of character.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Buck turned and glared into Slip&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, Slip, you&#8217;re helpless when it comes to
women. They&#8217;ve played the game for ten thousand
years, practised it every day, wearing down men&#8217;s
minds and men never knew it. Read history, as I&#8217;ve
done. Study psychology, as I have. Go down into
the fundamentals of human experience and human
activities, and learn the lesson. Fifteen years I&#8217;ve
been up and down these rivers, from Fort Benton to
the Passes, from the foothills of the Rockies to the
headwaters of Clinch and Holston in the Appalachians.
Why? Because one woman sang her way into my
heart, and because she tied my soul to her little finger,
and when she found that I could not escape&mdash;when she
had&mdash;when she had&mdash;What do you know about
women?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Slip stared at him. His pal, partner in river enterprises,
an old river man, who talked little and who
played the slickest games in the slickest way, had suddenly
emerged like a turtle&#8217;s head, and spoken in terms
of science, education, breeding&mdash;regular quality folks&#8217;
talk&mdash;under stress of an argument about women.
And they had argued the subject before with jest and
humour and without personal feeling.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Buck turned away, bent and shivering.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll roast up them squirrels fo&#8217; dinner?&#8221;
Slip suggested.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They&#8217;ll shore go good!&#8221; Buck assented. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
mux around some hot-bread, an&#8217; some gravy.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I got to make some meat soup for that feller, too.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Huh! Jest Prebol&#8217;s one of them damned fools
what tried to forget a woman among women,&#8221; Buck
sneered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>At intervals during the day Slip went over and gave
Prebol his medicine, or fed him on squirrel meat broth;
toward night they floated their 35-foot shanty-boat
out into the eddy, and anchored it a hundred yards
from the bank, where the sheriff of Lake County, Tennessee,
no longer had jurisdiction. In the late evening
Slip lighted a big carbide light and turned it toward
the town on the opposite bank.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Pretty soon they heard the impatient dip of skiff
oars, a river fisherman came aboard, and stood for a
minute over the heater stove, warming his fingers.
He soon went to the long, green-topped crap table in
the end of the room, and Slip stood opposite, to throw
bones against him. A tiny motorboat crossed a little
later; and three men, two heavy set and one a slim
youth, entered, to sit down at one of the little round
tables and play a game.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>One by one other patrons appeared, and soon there
were fourteen or fifteen. Slip and Buck glided about
among them quietly, their eyes alert, their hats drawn
down over their eyes, taking a hand here, throwing
bones there, poking up the coal fire, putting on coffee,
making sandwiches, every moment on the <i>qui vive</i>,
communicating with each other by jerks of the hand,
lifting of shoulders, or the faintest of whisperings.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A jar against the side of the boat sent one or other
of the two out to look, to greet a newcomer or to fend
off a drift log. A low whistle from the stern took
Buck through the aisle between the staterooms to
the kitchen where a rat-eyed little man waited him
on the stern deck,</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Lo, Buck! I&#8217;m drappin&#8217; down in a hurry; I learn
yo&#8217; was heah. Theh&#8217;s a feller drapping down out the
Ohio; he&#8217;s lookin&#8217; fo&#8217; a feller name of Jock Drones&mdash;didn&#8217;t
hear what for. Yo&#8217; know &#8217;im?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Nope, but I&#8217;ll pass the word around.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;S&#8217;long!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Jock Drones&mdash;huh!&#8221; Buck repeated, turning into
the lamp-lit kitchen where Slip was sniffing the coffee
pot.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Friend of mine just stopped,&#8221; Buck whispered.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a detective coming down out of the Ohio.
Told me to pass the word around. He&#8217;s after somebody
by the name of Drones, Dock or Jock Drones.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Slip started, turned white, and his jaws parted.
Buck&#8217;s eyes opened a little wider.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;S&#8217;all right, Slip! Keep your money in your belt,
to be ready to run or swim. It&#8217;s a long river.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Slip could not trust himself to speak. Buck, patting
him on the shoulder, went on into the card room
and closed the kitchen door behind him, drawing the
aisle curtains shut, too, so that no one would go back
until Slip had recovered his equilibrium.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Augustus Carline instinctively slowed down
his motorboat and took to looking at the wide
river, its quivering, palpitating surface; its vistas
at which he had to &#8220;look twice to see the end,&#8221; as the
river man says with whimsical accuracy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Negligent and thoughtless, he could now feel some
things which had never occurred to him before: his
loneliness, his doubts, his very helplessness and indecision.
His wife had been like an island around which
he sailed and cruised, sure in his consciousness that he
could return at any time to that safe mooring. He
had returned to find the island gone, himself adrift
on a boundless ocean, and he did not know which way
to turn. The cays and islets, the interesting rocks and
the questionable coral reefs supplied him with not the
slightest semblance of shelter, support, or safety.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He did not even know which side of the river to go to,
nor where to begin his search. He was wistful for
human companionship, but as he looked at the distant
shanty-boats, and passed a river town or two, he found
himself diffident and shamed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He saw a woman in a blue mother-hubbard dress
leaning against the cabin of her low, yellow shanty-boat,
a cap a-rake on her head, one elbow resting on her palm,
and in the other a long-stemmed Missouri meerschaum.
Her face was as hard as a man&#8217;s, her eyes were as blue
and level as a deputy sheriff&#8217;s in the Bad Lands, and
her lips were straight and thin. How could a man ask
her if she had seen his wife going down that way?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He stopped his motor and let his boat drift. He
wondered what he could or would say when he overtook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
Nelia. There struck across his imagination the figure
of a man, the Unknown who had, perhaps, promised
her the care he had never given her, the affection which
she had almost never had from him. Having won her,
this Unknown would likely defy him down there in that
awful openness and carelessness of the river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He found a feeling of insignificance making its way
into his mind. He had been vain of his looks, but what
did looks amount to down there? He had been proud
of his money, but what privilege did money give him
on that flood? He had rejoiced in his popularity and
the attention women paid him, but the indifferent gaze
of that smoking Amazon chilled his self-satisfaction.
He cringed as he seemed to see Nelia&#8217;s pretty eyes
glancing at him, her puzzled face as she apparently tried
to remember where she had seen him. The river wilted
the crumpling flower of his pride.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As his boat turned like a compass needle in the surface
eddies he saw a speck far up stream. He brought
out his binoculars and looked at it, thinking that it
was some toy boat, but to his astonishment it turned
out to be a man in a skiff.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It occurred to Carline that he wished he could talk
to someone, to any one, about anything. He had no
resources of his own to draw on. He had always been
obliged to be with people, talk to people, enjoy people;
the silences of his wife&#8217;s tongue had been more difficult
for him to bear than her edged words. The skiff traveller,
leisurely floating in that block of river, drew him
irresistibly. He kicked over the flywheel and steered
up stream, but only enough partly to overcome the
speed of the current. The sensation of being carried
down in spite of the motor power, complicated with
the rapid approach of the stranger in his skiff, was novel
and amusing. When he stopped the motor, the rowboat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
was within a hundred feet of him, and the two men
regarded each other with interest and caution.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The traveller was unusual, in a way. On his lap
was a portable typewriter, in the stern of the boat a
bundle of brown canvas; a brass oil stove was on the
bottom at the man&#8217;s feet; behind him in the bow were a
number of tins, cans, and boxes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Neither spoke for some time, and then Carline hailed:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Nice, pretty day on the river!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; the other replied. &#8220;Out the Ohio?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No&mdash;well, yes&mdash;I started at Evansville, where I
bought this boat, but I live up the Mississippi, at Kaskaskia&mdash;Gage,
they call it now.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes? I stopped at Menard&#8217;s on my way down from
St Louis.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;When was that?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;About ten days ago&mdash;tell you in a minute&mdash;Monday
a week!&#8221; A big quarto loose-leaf notebook had revealed
the day and date.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well, say&mdash;I&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221; Carline&#8217;s one question leaped
to his lips but remained unasked. For the minute he
could not ask it. The thing that had been his rage,
and then his wonder, suddenly drew back into his heart
as a secret sorrow.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come over?&#8221; Carline asked, &#8220;it&#8217;d be
company!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;ll be company,&#8221; the other admitted, and
with a pull of his oars brought the skiff alongside.
He climbed aboard, painter in hand, and making the
light line fast to one of the cleats, sat down on the locker
across from his host.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Carline.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s Lester Terabon; a newspaper let me come
down the river to write stories about it; it&#8217;s the biggest
thing I ever saw!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awful size!&#8221; Carline admitted, looking
around over his shoulder, and Terabon watched the
face.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Are you a river man?&#8221; the visitor asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No. My father was a big farmer, and he made
some money when they put a railroad through one of his
places.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Just tripping down to see the river?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No-o&mdash;well&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; Carline hesitated, looking overside
at the water.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That must be Wolf Island over there?&#8221; the reporter
suggested.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Carline looked at the island. He looked down the
main river and over toward the chute toward which
the Columbus bluffs had shunted them. Then he
started the motor and steered into the main channel
to escape the rippling shoals which flickered in the sunshine
ahead of them, past an island sandbar.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s Wolf Island.&#8221; Carline shook
his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for somebody&mdash;somebody
who came down this way.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The traveller waited. He looked across the current
to the bluffs now passing up stream, Columbus and all.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you find very much to write about,
coming down?&#8221; Carline changed his mind.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For answer Terabon drew his skiff alongside and
reached for his typewriter. As he began to write, he
said: &#8220;I write everything down&mdash;big or little. A man
can&#8217;t remember everything, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Make good money writing for the newspapers?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Enough to live on,&#8221; Terabon replied, &#8220;and, of
course, it&#8217;s living, coming down Old Mississip&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You like it travelling in that skiff? Where do you
sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I stretch that canvas between the gunwales in those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
staples; I put those hoops up, and draw a canvas over
the whole length of the boat. I can sleep like a baby
in its cradle.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s one way,&#8221; Carline replied, doubtfully.
&#8220;If I owned this old river, you could buy it for two
cents.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon laughed, and after a minute Carline joined
in, but he had told the truth. He hated the river, and
he was cowed by it; yet he could not escape its clutches.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I fancy it hasn&#8217;t always treated you right,&#8221; Terabon
remarked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Treated me right!&#8221; Carline doubled his fists and
stiffened where he sat. &#8220;It&#8217;s!&mdash;it&#8217;s&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He could not speak for his emotion, but his little
pointed chin trembled a minute later as he relaxed and
looked over his shoulder again. The typewriter clicked
along for minutes, Terabon&#8217;s fingers dancing over the
keys as he put down, word for word, and motion for
motion, the man who was afraid of the river and yet
was tripping down it. It seemed as though the man
afraid must have some kind of courage, too, because
he was going in spite of his fears.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s passing noon, and I think I&#8217;ll get something
to eat,&#8221; Terabon suggested; &#8220;I&#8217;ll get up my&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I forgot to eat!&#8221; Carline said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got everything,
and that knob there is a three-burner oil stove. We&#8217;ll
eat on board. Never mind your stuff, I&#8217;ve got so
much it&#8217;ll spoil&mdash;but I ain&#8217;t much of a cook!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m the original cook the C&aelig;sars wanted to buy for
gold!&#8221; Terabon boasted. &#8220;I got some squirrels, there,
I killed up on Buffalo Island, and we&#8217;ll fry them.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nor did he fail to make his boast good, for he soon
had hot-bread, gravy browned in the pan, boiled sweet
potatoes, and canned corn ready for the table. When
they sat down to eat, Carline confessed that he hadn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
had a real meal for a week except one he ate in a Cairo
restaurant.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I could have got a kind of a meal,&#8221; he admitted,
&#8220;but you see I was worried a good deal. Did you stop
at Stillhouse Island?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Just above Gage, kind of across from St. Genevieve.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see&mdash;oh, yes. There was an old fellow there,
what&#8217;s his name? He told me if I happened to see his
daughter I should tell her to write him, for her mother
wanted to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He said that! And you&mdash;it was Crele, Darien
Crele said that?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s the name&mdash;Nelia, his daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir. I know. I guess I know! She&#8217;s my
wife&mdash;she was&mdash;It&#8217;s her&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking for?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir; she ran away and left me. She came
down here.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Kind of a careless girl, I imagine?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Careless! God, no! The finest woman you ever
saw. It was me&mdash;I was to blame. I never knew, I
never knew!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For a minute he held up his arms, looking tensely at
the sky, struggling to overcome the emotion that long
had been boiling up in his heart, rending the self-complacency
of his mind. Then he broke down&mdash;broke
down abjectly, and fell upon the cabin floor, crying
aloud in his agony, while the newspaper man sitting
there whispered to himself:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Poor devil, here&#8217;s a story! He&#8217;s sure getting his.
I don&#8217;t want to forget this; got to put this down.
Poor devil!&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And he says he&#8217;s a sinner himself,&#8221; Nelia repeated,
when she returned on board her cabin-boat
in the sheltering safety of Wolf Island
chute, with Mamie Caope, Parson Rasba, and the
other shanty-boaters within a stone&#8217;s toss of her.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Till she was among them, among friends she trusted,
she had not noticed the incessant strain which she endured
down those long, grim river miles. Now she
could give way, in the privacy of her boat, to feminine
tears and bitterness. Courage she had in plenty, but
she had more sensitiveness than courage. She was not
yet tuned to the river harmonies.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Something in Rasba&#8217;s words, or it was in his voice,
or in the quick, full-flood of his glance, touched her
senses.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You see, missy, I&#8217;m a sinner myse&#8217;f!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>What had he meant? If he had meant that she, too,
was a sinner, was that any of his business? Of course,
being a parson&mdash;she shrugged her shoulders. Her
thoughts ran swiftly back to her home that used-to-be.
She laughed as she recalled the deprecatory little man
who had preached in the church she had occasionally
attended. She compared the trim, bird-like perspicuity
and wing-flap gestures of Rev. Mr. Beeve with the
slow, huge turn and stand-fast of Parson Rasba.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She was glad to escape the Mississippi down this
little chute; she was glad to have a phrase to puzzle
over instead of the ever-present problem of her own
future and her own fate; she was glad that she had
drifted in on Mrs. Mame Caope and Jim and Mr.
Falteau and Mrs. Dobstan and Parson Rasba, instead
of falling among those other kinds of people.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Mrs. Caope was an old acquaintance of her mother
who had lived all her life on the rivers. She was a
better boatman than most, and could pilot a stern-wheel
whiskey boat or set hoop nets for fish.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;If I get a man, and he&#8217;s mean,&#8221; Mrs. Caope had
said often, &#8220;I shift him. I &#8217;low a lady needs protection
up the bank er down the riveh, but I &#8217;low if my cookin&#8217;
don&#8217;t pay my board, an&#8217; if fish I take out&#8217;n my nets
ain&#8217;t my own, and the boat I live in ain&#8217;t mine&mdash;well,
I&#8217;ve drapped two men off&#8217;n the stern of my boat to
prove hit!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Mrs. Caope had not changed at all, not in the years
Nelia could recall, except to change her name. It was
the custom, to ask, perfectly respectfully, what name
she might be having now, and Mrs. Mame never took
offence, being good natured, and understanding how
hard it was to keep track of her matrimonial adventures,
episodes of sentiment but without any nonsense.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; Mrs. Caope had said once, &#8220;I disremember
if I couldn&#8217;t stand him er he couldn&#8217;t stand me!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia, adrift in her own life, and sure now that she
never had really cared very much for Gus Carline, admitted
to herself that her husband had been only a step
up out of the poverty and misery of her parents&#8217; shack.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You see, missy, I&#8217;m a sinner myse&#8217;f!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Her ears had caught the depths of the pathos of
his regret and sorrow, and she pitied him. At the
same time her own thoughts were ominous, and her
face, regular, bright, vivacious, showed a hardness
which was alien to it.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia went over to Mrs. Caope&#8217;s for supper, and Parson
Rasba was there, having brought in a wild goose
which he had shot on Wolf Island while going about his
meditations that afternoon. Mrs. Caope had the goose
sizzling in the big oven of her coal range&mdash;coal from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Pittsburgh barges wrecked along the river on bars&mdash;and
the big supper was sweeter smelling than Rasba ever
remembered having waited for.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Mrs. Caope told him to &#8220;ask one of them blessin&#8217;s
if yo&#8217; want, Parson!&#8221; and the four bowed their heads.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Jim Caope then fell upon the bird, neck, wings, and
legs, and while he carved Mrs. Caope scooped out the
dressing, piled up the fluffy biscuits, and handed around
the soup tureen full of gravy. Then she chased the
sauce with glass jars full of quivering jellies, reaching
with one hand to take hot biscuits from the oven while
she caught up the six-quart coffee pot with the other.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no patience with them women that don&#8217;t
feed their men!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;About all men
want&#8217;s a full stomach, anyhow, an&#8217; if you could only
git one that wa&#8217;n&#8217;t lazy, an&#8217; didn&#8217;t drink, an&#8217; wasn&#8217;t
impedent, an&#8217; knowed anything, besides, you&#8217;d have
something. Ain&#8217;t that so, Nelia?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, indeed yes,&#8221; Nelia cried, from the fullness of
her experience, which was far less than that of the
hostess.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>After they had eaten, they went from the kitchen into
the sitting room, where Rasba turned to Nelia.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You came down the river alone?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she admitted.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I wonder you wouldn&#8217;t be scairt up of it&mdash;nights,
and those lonesome bends?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s better than some other things.&#8221; Nelia shook
her head. &#8220;Besides, you&#8217;ve come alone down the Ohio
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He looked at her, and Mrs. Caope chuckled.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But&mdash;but you&#8217;re a woman!&#8221; Rasba exclaimed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Suppose a mean man came aboard your boat, and&mdash;and
tried to rob you,&#8221; Nelia asked, level voiced, &#8220;what
would you do?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, course, I&#8217;d&mdash;I&#8217;d likely stop him.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;d throw him overboard?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well&mdash;if hit were clost to the bank an&#8217; he could
swim, I mout.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia and the Caopes laughed aloud, and Rasba
joined in the merriment. When the laughter had subsided,
Rasba said:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;The reason I was asking, as I came by the River
Forks I found a little red boat there with a man on the
cabin floor shot through&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Dead?&#8221; Nelia gasped.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, just kind of pricked up a bit, into one shoulder.
He said a lady shot him because he &#8217;lowed to land into
the same eddy with her.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But&mdash;where&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221; Nelia half-whispered. &#8220;Where
did he go?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit were Jest Prebol,&#8221; Mrs. Caope said. &#8220;You
was tellin&#8217; of him, Parson.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit were Prebol,&#8221; Rasba nodded, &#8220;an&#8217; he shore
needed shooting!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh. That kind has to be shot some to make
&#8217;em behave theirselves,&#8221; Mrs Caope exclaimed, sharply.
&#8220;If it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t fer ladies shootin&#8217; men onct in awhile, down
Old Mississip&#8217;, why, ladies couldn&#8217;t git to live here
a-tall!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And women, sometimes, don&#8217;t do men any good,&#8221;
Rasba mused, aloud, &#8220;I&#8217;ve wondered right smart about
hit. You see, a parson circuit rides around, an&#8217; he
sees a sight more&#8217;n he tells. Lawse, he shore do!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The two women glared at him, but he was studying
his huge hands, first the backs and then the calloused
palms. He was really wondering, so the two women
glanced at each other, laughing. The idea that probably
some men needed protection from women could
not help but amuse while it exasperated them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Prebol said,&#8221; Rasba continued, &#8220;hit were a pretty
woman, young an&#8217; alone. &#8216;How&#8217;d I know?&#8217; he asked.
&#8216;How&#8217;d I know she were a spit-fire an&#8217; mean, theh all
alone into a lonesome bend? How&#8217;d I know?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I &#8217;low he shore found out,&#8221; Mrs. Caope spoke up,
tartly, and Nelia looked at her gratefully. &#8220;Hit takes
a bullet to learn fellers like Jest Prebol&mdash;an&#8217; him thinkin&#8217;
he&#8217;s so smart an&#8217; such a lady killer. I bet he knows
theh&#8217;s some ladies that&#8217;s men killers, too, now. Next
time he meets a lady he&#8217;ll wait to be invited &#8217;fore he
lands into the same eddy with her, even if hit&#8217;s a three-mile
eddy.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Theh&#8217;s Mrs. Minah,&#8221; Jim Caope suggested.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Mrs. Minah!&#8221; Mrs. Caope exclaimed. &#8220;Talk
about riveh ladies&mdash;theh&#8217;s one. She owns Mozart
Bend. Seventeen mile of Mississippi River&#8217;s her&#8217;n,
an&#8217; nobody but knows hit, if not to start with, then by
the end. She stands theh, at the breech of her rifle,
and, ho law, cayn&#8217;t she shoot! She&#8217;s real respectable,
too, cyarful an&#8217; &#8217;cordin&#8217; to law. She&#8217;s had seven
husbands, four&#8217;s daid an&#8217; two&#8217;s divorced, an&#8217; one she&#8217;s
got yet, &#8217;cordin&#8217; to the last I hearn say about it. I tell
you, if a lady&#8217;s got any self-respect, she&#8217;ll git a divorce,
an&#8217; she&#8217;ll git married ag&#8217;in. That&#8217;s what I say, with
divorces reasonable, like they be, an&#8217; costin&#8217; on&#8217;y
$17.50 to Mendova, or Memphis, er mos&#8217; anywheres.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;How long&mdash;how long does it take?&#8221; Nelia asked,
eagerly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, hardly no time at all. You jes&#8217; go theh, an&#8217;
the lawyer he takes all he wants to know, an&#8217; he says
come ag&#8217;in, an&#8217; next day, er the next trip, why, theh&#8217;s
yo&#8217; papers, an&#8217; all for $17.50. Seems like they&#8217;s got
special reg&#8217;lations for us shanty-boaters.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to know about that,&#8221; Nelia said. &#8220;I
thought&mdash;I never knew much about&mdash;about divorces.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
I thought there was a lot of&mdash;of rigmarole and testimony
and court business.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Nope! I tell yo&#8217;, some of them Mendova lawyers
is slick an&#8217; &#8217;commodatin&#8217;. Why, one time I was in an
awful hurry, landin&#8217; in &#8217;long of the upper ferry, an&#8217; I
went up town, an&#8217; seen the lawyer, an&#8217; told him right
how I was fixed. Les&#8217; see, that wa&mdash;um-m&#8211;&#8211;Oh,
I &#8217;member now, Jasper Hill. I&#8217;d married him up the
line, I disremember&mdash;anyhow, &#8217;fore I&#8217;d drapped down
to Cairo, I knowed he&#8217;d neveh do, nohow, so I left him
up the bank between Columbus an&#8217; Hickman&mdash;law
me, how he squawked! Down by Tiptonville, where
I&#8217;d landed, they was a real nice feller, Mr. Dickman.
Well, we kind of co&#8217;ted along down, one place an anotheh,
an&#8217; he wanted to git married. I told how hit was,
that I wasn&#8217;t &#8217;vorced, an&#8217; so on, but if he meant business,
we&#8217;d drap into Mendova, which we done. He
wanted to pay for the divorce, but I&#8217;m independent
thataway. I think a lady ought to pay for her own
&#8217;vorces, so I done hit, an&#8217; I was divorced at 3 o&#8217;clock,
married right next door into the Justice&#8217;s, an&#8217; we drapped
out an&#8217; down the riveh onto our honeymoon. Mr.
Dickman was a real gentleman, but, somehow, he
couldn&#8217;t stand the riveh. It sort of give him the malary,
an&#8217; he got to thinking about salmon fishin&#8217; so he
went to the Columbia. We parted real good friends,
but the Mississippi&#8217;s good &#8217;nough for me, yes, indeed.
I kind of feel zif I knowed hit, an&#8217; hit&#8217;s real homelike.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It is lovely down here,&#8221; Nelia remarked. &#8220;Everything
is so kind of&mdash;kind of free and easy. But wasn&#8217;t
it dreadful&mdash;I mean the first time&mdash;the first divorce,
Mamie?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Course, yes, course,&#8221; Mrs. Caope admitted, slowly,
with a frown, &#8220;I neveh will forget mine. I&#8217;d shifted
my man, an&#8217; I was right down to cornmeal an&#8217; bacon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
Then a real nice feller come along, Mr. Darlet. I had
to take my choice between a divorce an&#8217; a new weddin&#8217;
dress, an&#8217; I tell you hit were real solemocholy fer me
decidin&#8217; between an&#8217; betwixt. You know how young
gals are, settin&#8217; a lot by dresses an&#8217; how they look, an&#8217;
so on. Young gals ain&#8217; got much but looks, anyhow.
Time a lady gits experience, she don&#8217;t set so much
store by looks, an&#8217; she don&#8217;t have to, nohow. Well,
theh I was, with a nice man, an&#8217; if I didn&#8217;t divorce that
first scoundrel where&#8217;d I be? So I let the dress go, an&#8217;
mebby you&#8217;ll b&#8217;lieve hit, an&#8217; mebby yo&#8217; won&#8217;t, but I
had $18.97, an&#8217; I paid my $17.50 real reg&#8217;lar, an&#8217; I
had jest what was left, $1.47, an&#8217; me ready to bust out
crying, feelin&#8217; so mean about marryin&#8217; into an old walking
skirt.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I was all alone, an&#8217; I had a good notion to run down
the back way, an&#8217; trip off down the riveh without no
man, I felt so &#8217;shamed. An&#8217; theh, right on the sidewalk,
was a wad of bills, $99 to a penny. My lan&#8217;!
I wropped my hand around hit, an&#8217; yo&#8217; should of seen
Mr. Darlet when he seen me come walking down, new
hat, new dress, new shoes, new silk stockings&mdash;the whole
business new. I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t such a bad-lookin&#8217; gal, afteh
all. That taught me a lesson. I&#8217;ve always be&#8217;n real
savin&#8217; sinct then, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t be&#8217;n ketched sinct with the
choice to make of a &#8217;vorce er a weddin&#8217; dress. No,
indeed, not me!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Parson Rasba looked at her, and Nelia, her eyes
twinkling, looked at the Parson. Nelia could understand
the feelings in all their minds. She had her own
viewpoint, too, which was exceedingly different from
those of the others. The strain of weeks of questioning,
weeks of mental suffering, was relieved by the river
woman&#8217;s serious statement and Parson Rasba&#8217;s look
of bewilderment at the kaleidoscopic matrimonial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
adventuring. At the same time, his wonder and Mrs.
Caope&#8217;s unconscious statement stirred up in her
thoughts a new questioning.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When Nelia returned on board her boat, and sat in
its cabin, a freed woman, she very calmly reckoned
up the advantages of Mrs. Caope&#8217;s standards. Then
seeing that it was after midnight, and that only the
stars shone in that narrow, wooded chute, she felt she
wanted to go out into the wide river again, to go where
she was not shut in. She cast off her lines and noiselessly
floated out and down the slow current.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She saw Parson Rasba&#8217;s boat move out into the current
behind her and drift along in the soft, autumn
night. Her first thought was one of indignation, but
when a little later they emerged into the broad river
current and she felt the solitude of the interminable
surface, her mood changed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>What the big, quizzical mountain parson had in
mind she did not know. It was possible that he was a
very bad man, indeed. She could not help but laugh
under her breath at his bewilderment regarding Mrs.
Caope, which she felt was a genuine expression of his
real feelings. At the same time, whatever his motive
in following her, whether it was to protect her&mdash;which
she could almost believe&mdash;or to court her, which was
not at all unlikely, or whether he had a baser design,
she did not know, but she felt neither worry nor fear.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; she shook her head, defiantly, &#8220;I

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t fair!&#8221; Carline exclaimed. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t a
man enjoy himself and have a good time, and not&mdash;and
not&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Have a headache the next day?&#8221; Terabon finished
the sentence with a grave face.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m not what you&#8217;d call a hard drinker;
I like to take a cocktail, or a whiskey, the same as any
man. I like to go out around and see folks, talk to
&#8217;em, dance&mdash;you know, have a good time!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Everybody does,&#8221; Terabon admitted.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And my wife, she wouldn&#8217;t go around and she was&mdash;she
was&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Jealous because you wanted to use your talents to
entertain?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s it. You understand! I&#8217;m a good
fellow; I like to joke around and have a good time.
Take a man that don&#8217;t go around, and he&#8217;s a dead one.
It ain&#8217;t as though she couldn&#8217;t be a good sport&mdash;Lord!
Why, I&#8217;d just found out she was the best sport that ever
lived. I thought everything was all right. Next day
she was gone&mdash;tricky as the devil! Why, she got me
to sign up a lot of papers, got all my spare cash, stocks,
bonds&mdash;everything handy. Oh, she&#8217;s slick! Bright,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
too&mdash;bright&#8217;s anybody. Why, she could talk about
books, or flowers, or birds&mdash;about anything. I never
took much interest in them.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And brought up in that shack on Distiller&#8217;s Island?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Stillhouse Island, yes, sir. What do you know
about that?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A remarkable woman!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;I&mdash;I&#8217;ve got some photographs,&#8221; and Carline
turned to a writing desk built into the motorboat.
He brought out fifteen or twenty photographs. Terabon
looked at them eagerly. He could not associate
the girl of the pictures with the island shack, with this
weakling man, nor yet with the Mississippi River&mdash;at
least not at that moment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;She&#8217;s beautiful,&#8221; he exclaimed, sincerely.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; Carline packed the pictures away.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He started the motor, straightened the boat out and
steered into mid-stream, looking uncertainly from side
to side.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;There&#8217;s no telling,&#8221; he said, &#8220;not about anything.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;On the river no one can tell much about anything!&#8221;
Terabon assented.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;re just coming down, I suppose, looking for
hist&#8217;ries to write?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s about it. I just sit in the skiff, there, and
I write what I see, on the machine: A big sandbar, a
flock of geese, a big oak tree just on the brink of the
bank half the roots exposed and going to fall in a
minute or a day&mdash;everything like that!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I bet some of these shanty-boaters could tell you
histories,&#8221; Carline said. &#8220;I tell you, some of them are
bad. Why, they&#8217;d murder a man for ten dollars&mdash;those
river pirates would.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No doubt about it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But they wouldn&#8217;t talk, &#8217;course. It must be awful
hard to make up them stories in the magazines.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, if a man gets an idea, he can work it up into a
story. It takes work, of course, and time.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how anybody can do it.&#8221; Carline
shook his head. &#8220;There&#8217;s a man up to Gage. He wants
to write a book, but he ain&#8217;t never been able to find
anything to write about. You see, Gage ain&#8217;t much but
a little landing, you might say.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Chester, and the big penitentiary is just below there,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;d think there might be at least one story for him
to write there.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, he don&#8217;t want to write about crooks; he wants
to write about nice people, society people, and that
kind, and big cities. He says it&#8217;s awful hard to find
anybody to write about.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to look to find heroes,&#8221; Terabon admitted.
&#8220;I came more than a thousand miles to see a
shanty-boat.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You di-i-d? Just to see a shanty-boat!&#8221; Carline
stared at Terabon in amazement.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In spite of Terabon being such a queer duck he made
a good companion. He was a good cook, for one thing,
and when they landed in below Hickman Bend, he
went ashore and killed three squirrels and two black
ducks in the woods and marsh beyond the new levee.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When he returned, he found a skiff landed near by on
the sandbar. Carline was talking to the man, who had
just handed over a gallon jug. The man pulled away
swiftly and disappeared down the chute. Carline
explained:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;s a whiskey pedlar; a man always needs to
have whiskey on board; malaria is bad down here, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
a fellow might catch cold. You see how it is if a man
don&#8217;t have some whiskey on board.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; Terabon admitted.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>After supper Carline decided that there was a lot
of night air around, and that a man couldn&#8217;t take too
many precautions against that deadly river miasma
whose insidious menace so many people have ignored
to their great cost. As for himself, Carline didn&#8217;t
propose to be taken bad when he had so universal a
specific, to take or leave alone, just as he wanted.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon, having put up the hoops of his skiff and
stretched the canvas over them, retired to his own
boat and spent two hours writing.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In the morning, when he stirred out, he found Carline
lying in the engine pit, oblivious to the night air that
had fallen upon him, protected as he was by his absorption
of the sure preventive of night air getting him
first. The jug was on the floor, and Terabon, after a
little thought, poured out about two and a half quarts
which he replaced with distilled water from the motorboat&#8217;s
drinking bottle. Then he dropped down the
chute into the main river to resume his search for really
interesting &#8220;histories.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The river had never been more glorious than that
morning. The sun shone from a white, misty sky. It
was warm, with the slight tang of autumn, and the yellow
leaves were fluttering down; squirrels were barking,
and a flock of geese, so high in the air that they
sparkled, in the sunshine, were gossiping, and the
music of their voices rained upon the river surface
as upon a sounding board.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon was approaching Donaldson&#8217;s Point, Winchester
Chute, Island No. 10, and New Madrid. An
asterisk on his map showed that Slough Neck was interesting,
and sure enough, he found a 60-foot boat just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
above Upper Slough Landing, anchored off the sandbar.
This was a notorious whiskey boat, and just
below it was a flight of steps up the steep bank. No
plantation darky ever used those steps. He would
rather scramble in the loose silt and risk his neck than
climb that easy stairway&mdash;yes, indeed!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon, drifting by, close at hand, gazed at the
scene. From that craft Negroes had gone forth to
commit crime; white men had gone out to do murder,
and one of them had rolled down those steps, shot dead.
On the other side of Slough Neck, just outside of Tiptonville,
there was a tree on which seven men had been
lynched.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He pulled across to the foot of Island No. 10 sandbar,
to walk up over that historic ground, and to visit
the remnants of Winchester Chute where General
Grant had moored barges carrying huge mortars with
which to drop shells into the Confederate works on
Island No. 10.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He hailed a shanty-boat just below where he landed,
and as the window opened and he saw someone within,
he asked:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Will you kindly watch my skiff? I&#8217;m going up
over the island.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, glad to!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; He bowed, and went upon his exploration.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was hard to believe that this sandbar, grown to
switch willows which increased to poles six or seven
inches in diameter, had once been a big island covered
with stalwart trees, with earthworks, cannon, and desperate
soldiers. Its serene quiet, undulating sands
and casual weed-trees, showing the stain of floods that
had filled the bark with sediment, proved the indifference
of the river to fleeting human affairs&mdash;the trifling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
work of human hands had been washed away in a
spring tide or two, and Island No. 10 was half way to
the Gulf by this time.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon returned to his skiff three or four hours
later, and taking up his typewriter, began to write
down what he had seen, elaborating the pencil notes
which he had made. As he wrote he became conscious
of an observer, and of the approach of someone
who was diffident and curious&mdash;a familiar enough
sensation of late.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He looked up, started, and reached for his hat. It
was a woman, a young woman, with bright eyes, grace,
dignity&mdash;and much curiosity.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to disturb you,&#8221; she apologized. &#8220;I
was just wondering what on earth you could be doing!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m writing&mdash;making notes&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes. But&mdash;here!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m a newspaper writer,&#8221; he made his familiar
statement. &#8220;My name is Lester Terabon. I&#8217;m from
New York. I came down here from St. Louis to see
the Mississippi.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You write for newspapers?&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She came and sat down on the bow deck of his skiff,
frankly curious and interested.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Nelia Crele,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;m a
shanty-boater. That&#8217;s my boat.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m glad to meet you,&#8221; he bowed, &#8220;Mrs.
Crele.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You find lots to write about?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I can&#8217;t write fast enough,&#8221; he replied, enthusiastically,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been coming six weeks&mdash;from St. Louis.
I&#8217;ve made more than 60,000 words in notes already, and
the more I make the more I despair of getting it all down.
Why, right here&mdash;New Madrid, Island 10, and&mdash;and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And me?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Did you stop at Gage?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;At Stillhouse Island,&#8221; he admitted, circumspectly.
&#8220;Mr. Crele there said I should be sure and tell his
daughter, if I happened to meet her, that her mother
wanted her to be sure and write and let her know how
she is getting along.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; she assured him. &#8220;I was just
writing home when you landed in. Isn&#8217;t it strange
how everybody knows everybody down here, and how
you keep meeting people you know&mdash;that you&#8217;ve heard
about? You knew me when you saw me!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I&#8217;d seen your pictures.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Mammy hadn&#8217;t but one picture of me!&#8221; She stared
at him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; he thought, unused to such quick
thought.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it beautiful?&#8221; she asked him, looking around
her. &#8220;Do you try to write all that, too&mdash;I mean this
sandbar, and those willows, and that woods down
there, and&mdash;the caving bank?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Everything,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;See?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He handed her the page which he had just written.
Holding it in one hand&mdash;there was hardly a breath of
air stirring&mdash;she read it word for word.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it!&#8221; She nodded her head. &#8220;How
do you do it? I&#8217;ve just been reading&mdash;let me see,
&#8216;... the best romance becomes dangerous if by its
excitement it renders the ordinary course of life uninteresting,
and&mdash;and&#8211;&#8211;&#8217; I&#8217;ve forgotten the rest of it.
Could anything make this life down here&mdash;anything
written, I mean&mdash;seem uninteresting?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He looked at her without answering. What was this
she was saying? What was this shanty-boat woman,
this runaway wife, talking about? He was dazed at
being transported so suddenly from his observations to
such reflections.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he replied, inanely. &#8220;I remember
reading that&mdash;somewhere!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;ve read Ruskin?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Really, have
you?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sesame and Lilies&mdash;there&#8217;s where it was!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, you know?&#8221; she exclaimed, looking at him.
He caught the full flash of her delight, as well as surprise,
at finding someone who had read what she
quoted, and could place the phrase.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;The sun&#8217;s bright,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
come down on my boat in the shade? I&#8217;ve lots of
books, and I&#8217;m hungry&mdash;I&#8217;m starving to talk to somebody
about them!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was a pretty little boat, sweet and clean; the sitting
room was draped with curtains along the walls, and
there was a bookcase against the partition. She drew a
rocking chair up for him, drew her own little sewing
chair up before the shelves, and began to take out
books.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had but to sit there and show his sympathy with
her excitement over those books. He could not help
but remember where he had first heard her name, seen
the depressed woman who was her mother. And the
bent old hunter who was her father. It was useless for
him to try to explain her.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Just that morning, too, he had left Nelia Crele&#8217;s
husband in an alcoholic stupor&mdash;a man almost incredibly
stupid!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t mind listening to me prattle!&#8221;
she laughed, archly. &#8220;You&#8217;re used to it. You&#8217;re
amused, too, and you&#8217;re thinking what a story I will
make, aren&#8217;t you, now?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;If&mdash;if a man could only write you!&#8221; he said, with
such sincerity that she laughed aloud with glee.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve read books!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I know&mdash;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
been miserable, and I&#8217;ve been unhappy, but I&#8217;ve
turned to the books, and they&#8217;ve told me. They kept
me alive&mdash;they kept me above those horrid little things
which a woman&mdash;which I have. You&#8217;ve never been
in jail, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What&mdash;in jail? I&#8217;ve been there, but not a prisoner.
To see prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t know, then, the way prisoners feel.
I know. I reckon most women know. But now I&#8217;m
out of jail. I&#8217;m free.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He could not answer; her eyes flashed as they narrowed,
and she fairly glared at him in the intensity of
her declaration.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, you couldn&#8217;t know,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;but that&#8217;s
the way I feel. I&#8217;m free! Isn&#8217;t the river beautiful
to-day? I&#8217;m like the river&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Which is kept between two banks?&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I can well admit that,&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, in mock rebuke, &#8220;the idea!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s your own&mdash;and a very brilliant one,&#8221; he retorted,

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There was no resisting the gale of Nelia Crete&#8217;s
effervescent spirits. It was clear that she had burst

for years. Terabon was too acute an observer to
frighten the sensitive exhilaration. It would pass&mdash;he
was only too sure of that. What would follow?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The sandbar was miles long, miles wide; six or seven
miles of caving bend was visible below them, part
of it over another sandbar that extended out into the
river. There was not a boat, house, human being, or
even fence in sight in any direction. Across the river
there was a cotton field, but so far away it was that the
stalks were but a purple haze under the afternoon sun.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The Mississippi River brings people from the
most distant places to close proximity; Pittsburg
and even Salamanca meet Fort Benton
and St. Paul at the Forks of the Ohio. On the other
hand, with uncanny certainty, those most eager to
meet are kept apart and thrown to the ends of the
world.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Parson Rasba saw Nelia Crele&#8217;s boat drift out into
the current and drop down the Chute of Wolf Island,
and impelled by solitude and imagination he followed
her. She had awakened sensations in his heart which
he had never before known, so he acted with primitive
directness and moved out into the Mississippi.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The river carried him swiftly toward a town whose
electric lights sparkled on a high bluff, Hickman, and
he saw the cabin-boat of the young and venturesome
woman clearly outlined between him and the town.
For nearly an hour he was conscious of the assistance
of the river in carrying him along at an even pace,
permitting him to remain as guardian of the woman.
He felt that she needed him, that he must help her, and
there grew in his heart an emotion which strangely
made him desire to sing and to shout.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He watched the cabin-boat drift down right into the
pathway of reflections that fell from the lights on Hickman
bluffs. His eyes were apparently fixed upon the
boat, and he could not lose sight of it. The river carried
him right into the same glare, and for a few minutes
he looked up at the arcs, and shaded his eyes to
get some view of the town whose sounds consisted of
the mournful howling of a dog.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba looked back at the town, and felt the awe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
which a sleeping village inspires in the thoughts of a
passer-by. He thought perhaps he would never again
see that town. He wondered if there was a lost soul
there whose slumberings he could disturb and bring it
to salvation. He looked down the river, and the next
instant his boat was seized as by a strong hand and
whirled around and around, and flung far from its
course. He remembered the phenomenon at the Forks
of the Ohio, and again at Columbus bluff&#8217;s. With difficulty
he found his bearings.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He looked around and saw to his surprise that he
was drifting up stream. He looked about him in
amazement. He searched the blackness of the river,
and stared at the blinding lights of the town. He began
to row with his sweeps, and look down stream whither
had disappeared the cabin-boat whose occupant he had
felt called upon to guard and protect.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>That boat was gone. In the few minutes it had disappeared
from his view. He surmised, at last, that
he had been thrust into an eddy, for the current was
carrying him up stream, and he rowed against it in
vain. Only when he had floated hundreds of yards in
the leisurely reverse current below the great bar of
Island No. 6 and had drifted out into the main current
again, almost under the Hickman lights once more, was
he able in his ignorance to escape from the time-trap
into which he had fallen.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Standing at his oars, and rowing down stream, he
tried to overtake the young woman whose good looks,
bright eyes, sympathetic understanding, and need of
his spiritual tutoring had caught his mind and made
it captive.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Dawn, following false dawn, saw him passing New
Madrid, still rowing impatiently, his eyes staring down
the wild current, past a graveyard poised ready to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
plunge on the left bank, and then down the baffling
crossing at Point Pleasant and through the sunny
breadths up to Tiptonville, half sunk in the river, only
to fall away toward Little Cypress&mdash;and still no sight
of the lost cabin-boat.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In mid-afternoon, weary and worn by sleeplessness
and expectancy, he pulled his boat into the deadwater
at the foot of an eddy and having thrown over his stone
anchor, sadly entered his cabin and, without prayer,
subsided into sleep.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>If he dreamed he was not awakened to consciousness
by his visions. He slept on in the deep weariness which
followed the wakefulness that had continued through a
night of undiminished anxiety into a day of doubt and
increasing despair. It had not occurred to him, in his
simplicity, that the young woman would escape from
him. The shadow and the gloom next to the bank on
either side had not suggested his passing by the object of
his intention. His thought was that she must have
gone right on down stream, though he might have
divined from his own condition that she, too, long since
must have been weary.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He awakened some time in the morning, after twelve
hours or so of uninterrupted slumber. He turned out
into the fascinating darkness of early morning on the
Mississippi. A gust of chill wind swept down out of
the sky, rippling the surface and roaring through the
woods up the bank. The gust was followed by a raw
calm and further blanketing of the few stars that penetrated
the veil of mist.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had in mind the further pursuit of Nelia, and
hauling in his anchor he pulled out into mid-current
and then by lamp-light prepared his breakfast. While
he worked, he discovered that dawn was near, and at
lengthening intervals he went out to look ahead, hoping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
to see the object of his pursuit. Perhaps he would
have gone on down to New Orleans, only it is not written
in Mississippi weather prophecies that the tenor of
one&#8217;s way shall be even.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He heard wind blowing, and felt his boat bobbing
about inexplicably. He went out to look about him,
and in the morning twilight he discovered that the
whole aspect of the Mississippi had changed. With
the invisible sunrise had come an awe-inspiring spectacle
which excited in his mind forebodings and dismay.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>First, there was the cold wind which penetrated his
clothes and shrivelled the very meat of his bones.
The river&#8217;s surface, which he had come to regard as a
shimmering, polished floor, was now rumpled and
broken into lumpy waves, like mud on a road, and the
waves broke into dull yellow foam caps. There was
not a light gleam on the whole surface, and dark shadows
seemed to crawl and twist about in the very substance
of the heavy and turgid waters.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba stared. Born and trained in mountains,
where he remembered clear streams of pale, beautiful
green, catching reflections of white clouds and clean
foliage, with only occasional patches of sullen clay-bank
wash, he refused to acknowledge the great tawny Mississippi
at its best, as a relation of the streams he knew.
Certainly this menacing dawn reminded him of nothing
he had ever witnessed. Waves slapped against
his boat, waves which did not conceal, but rather accentuated,
the sullen and relentless rush of the vast
body of the water. While the surface leaped and struggled,
wind-racked, the deeps moved steadily on. Elijah
saw that his boat was being driven into a river chute,
and seizing his sweeps, he began to row toward a
sandbar which promised shoal water and a landing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He managed to strike the foot of the bar, and threw
out his anchor rock. He let go enough line to let the
boat swing, and went in to breakfast. While he was
eating, he noticed that the table turned gray and that
a yellowish tinge settled upon everything. When he
went out to look around, he found that the air was full
of a cloud that filled his eyes with dust, and that a little
drift of sand had already formed on the deck of his
boat, gritting under his feet. The cloud was so thick
that he could hardly see the river shores; a gale was
blowing, and a whole sandbar, miles long, was coming
down upon him from the air. The sandbar, when
he looked at it, seemed fairly to be running, like water.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Parson Rasba remembered the storms of biblical
times, and better understood the wrath that was visited
upon the Children of Israel.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He dwelt in that storm all that day. He shut the
door to keep the sand out, but it spurted through the
cracks. He could see the puffing gusts as they burst
through the keyhole, and he could hear the heavier
grains rattling upon the thin, painted boards of his
roof. His clothes grayed, his hands gritted, his teeth
crunched fine stone; he pondered upon the question of
what sin he had committed to bring on him this ancient
punishment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For a long time his finite mind was without inspiration,
without understanding, and then he choked with
terror and regret. He had beguiled himself into
believing that it was his duty to take care of Nelia
Crele, the fair woman of the river. He had believed
only too readily that his duty lay where his heart&#8217;s
desire had been most eager. He sat there in dumb
horror at the sin which had blinded him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I come down yeah to find Jock Drones for his
mother!&#8221; He reminded himself by speaking his mission
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
aloud, adding, &#8220;And hyar I&#8217;ve be&#8217;n floating down looking
for a woman, looking for a pretty woman!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>And because he could remember her shoes, the smooth
leather over those exquisite ankles, Parson Rasba knew
that his sin was mortal, and that no other son of man
had ever strayed so far as he.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No wonder he was caught in a desert blizzard where
no one had ever said there was a desert!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Lord God,&#8221; he cried out, &#8220;he&#8217;p this yeah po&#8217;r

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Jock, <i>alias</i> &#8220;Slip,&#8221; Drones, was discovering
how small the world really is. Like many
another man, he had figured that no one would
know him, no one could possibly find him, down the
Mississippi River, more than a thousand miles from
home. Having killed, or at least fought his man in a
deadly feud war, he had escaped into the far places.
His many months of isolation had given him confidence
and taken the natural uneasiness of flight from his
mind.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Now someone was coming down the Mississippi inquiring
for Jock Drones! A detective, as relentless,
as sure as a bullet in the heart, was coming. He might
even then be lurking in the brush up the bank, waiting
to get a sure drop. He might be dropping down that
very night. He might step in among the players, unnoticed,
unseen, and wait there for the moment of
surprise and action.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Slip&#8217;s mind ransacked the far places of which he had
heard: Oklahoma, the Missouri River, California, the
Mexican border, Texas. Far havens seemed safest,
but against their lure he felt the balance of Buck&#8217;s
comradeship.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Caruthersville had a sporting crowd with money,
lots of money. The people there were liberal spenders,
and they liked a square game better than any other
sport in the world. The boat was making good money,
big money. The two partners had only to break even
in their own play to make a big living out of the kitty
in the poker tables, and there was always a big percentage
in favour of the boat, because Buck and Slip
understood each other so well. Slip&#8217;s share often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
amounted to more in a week than he had earned in two
years up there in the mountains felling trees, rafting
them in eddies, and tripping them down painfully to the
sawmills. These never did pay the price they were advertised
to pay for timber, and one had to watch the
sealers to see that they didn&#8217;t short the measure in the
under water and goose-egg good logs.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He remembered Jest Prebol, who was lying shot
through in the boat alongside, and he went over to the
boat, lighted the lamp, and sat down by the wounded
man. Prebol was a little delirious, and Slip went over
on his own boat, and called Buck out.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;We got a sick man on our hands,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t Doc Grell come oveh yet?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Come the last boat,&#8221; Buck said, and called the
doctor out.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Say, Doc, that sick feller out here, will you look&#8217;t
him?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Doctor Grell went over to the boat. He looked at
the wounded man, and frowned as he took the limp
wrist. He tried the temperature, too, and then shook
his head.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;s a sick man, Slip,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Thought he
was coming all right last night. Now&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He looked at the wound, and gazed at the great, blue
plate around the bullet hole.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;s bad?&#8221; Slip said, in alarm. &#8220;Poison&#8217;s workin&#8217;,
Doc?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Mighty bad!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There was nothing for it. Doctor Grell&#8217;s night of
pleasure had turned into one of life-saving and effort.
He sent Slip over to drag away one of the young men
from his game, and they rigged up two square trunks
and a waterproof tarpaulin into an operating table.
Then, as Slip was faint and sick, the two drove him back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
to the gambling boat, while they, the graduate and the
student, entered upon a gamble with a human life the
stake.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Of that night&#8217;s efforts, fighting the &#8220;poison&#8221; with
the few sharp weapons at their command&mdash;later reinforced
by a hasty trip across the river to get others&mdash;the
two need never tell. While they worked, they
could hear at intervals the shout of a winner in the
other boat. In moments of perfect quiet they heard
the quick rustling of shuffled cards; they heard the
rattling of dice in hard, muffled boxes; they heard, at
intervals, the rattling of stove lids and smelt the soft-coal
smoke which blew down on them from the kitchen
chimney. Slip, not forgetful of them, brought over
pots of black coffee and inquired after the patient. He
found the two men paler on each visit, and stripped
down more and more, till they were merely in their
sweaty undershirts.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Toward morning the wind began to blow; it began
to grow cold. The noises on the neighbouring boat
grew fainter in the low rumble of a stormy wind out of
the northwest, and the shanty-boat lifted at intervals
on a wave that rolled out of the main current and across
the eddy, making their operating room even more
unstable.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Under their onslaught the death which was taking
hold of Jest Prebol was checked, and the river rat
whose life had been forfeited for his sly crimes became
the object of a doctor&#8217;s sentiment and belief in his own
training.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Long after midnight, when some few of the patrons
of the games had already taken their departure, the
doors opened oftener and oftener, letting the geometrical
shaft of the yellow light flare out across the waters,
and the grotesque shadows of those who departed stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
out against the night and waters as the men shivered
in the wind and bent to feel their way into the boats.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>After dawn Doctor Grell and his assistant, peaked
and white, limp with their tremendous effort, and shivering
with exhaustion of mind and body, walked out of
the little shanty-boat, up to the big one, sat down with
Buck and Slip to breakfast, and then took their own
course across the ruffled and tumble-surfaced river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I &#8217;low he&#8217;ll pull through,&#8221; Doctor Grell admitted,
almost reluctantly. &#8220;He&#8217;s in bad shape, though, with
the things the bullet carried into him, but we sure
swabbed him out. How&#8217;d the game go to-night,
boys?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Purty good.&#8221; Buck shook his head. &#8220;Tammer
sure had luck his way&mdash;won a seventy-dollar pot onct.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I sure wanted to play,&#8221; Grell shook his head, &#8220;but
in my profession you aren&#8217;t your own, and you cayn&#8217;t
quit.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;We owe you for it,&#8221; Buck said. &#8220;He&#8217;s our
friend&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And he&#8217;s ourn, too,&#8221; Grell declared, &#8220;so we&#8217;ll
split the difference. I expect it was worth a hundred
dollars what we two did to-night. That&#8217;ll be fifty,
boys, if it&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, suh,&#8221; Slip said, handing over five ten-dollar
bills, and Grell handed two of them to his companion,
who shook his head, saying:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Nope, Doc! Ten only to-night. My first fee!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll never have a more interesting case,&#8221;
Grell declared. &#8220;No, indeed! You&#8217;ll see cases, come
you go to college, but none more interesting, and if
we&#8217;ve pulled him through, you&#8217;ll never have better
reason for satisfaction.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The two got into a little motorboat and went bounding
and rocking in the wind and waves toward the town
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
behind the levee on the far bank. The two gamblers
watched the little boat rocking along till it was but a
black fleck in the midst of the weltering brown waters.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon any one&#8217;ll drap down to-day,&#8221;
Slip muttered, looking up the river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep our eyes open,&#8221; Buck replied. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t to worry, you&#8217;re plumb worn out, Slip. Git to
bed, now, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll slick up around.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was a cold, dry gale. From sharp gusts with near
calms between the wind grew till it was a steady, driving
storm that flattened against the shanty-boat sides,
and whistled and roared through the trees up the bank.
And instead of dying down at dusk, it increased so much
that the big acetylene light was not hung out, and if
any one came down to the opposite shore he saw that
there would be no game that night.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Buck went in and sat down by the wounded man&#8217;s
bed, giving him the medicines Doctor Grell had left.
For the attentions Prebol, in lucid intervals, showed
wondering looks of gratitude, like an ugly dog which
has been trapped and then set free. What he had
suffered during the night even he could hardly recall in
the enfeebled condition of his mind, but the spoonfuls
of broth, the medicine that thrilled his body, the man&#8217;s
very companionship, lending strength, took away the
feeling of despair which a man in the extremities of
anguish and alone in the world finds hardest to resist.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Buck, sitting there, gazed at the wan countenance,
studying it. Prebol had forgotten, but when Buck
first arrived on the river, the pirate, a much younger
man then, had carelessly and perhaps for display told
the stranger and softpaw many things about the river
which were useful. It occurred to Buck that he was
now paying back a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Something boiled up in his thoughts, and he swore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
to himself that he owed nothing, that the world owed
him, and he bridged the years of his disappointment
and desolation back to the hour when he had stormed
out of the life he had known, to come down the Mississippi
to be a gambler. Prebol, in his lapses into delirium,
called a woman&#8217;s name, Sadie&mdash;always Sadie!
And if he would have cursed that name in his consciousness,
out of the depths of his soul it came with softness
and gentleness of affection.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Buck wondered what Jest Prebol had done to Sadie
that she had driven him down there, and he cursed
with his own lips, while he stifled in the depths of his
own soul another name. His years, his life, had been
wasted, just as this man Prebol&#8217;s life was wasted, just
as Slip&#8217;s life was being wasted. Buck gave himself
over to the exquisite torture of memories and reflections.
He wondered what had become of the woman
for love of whom he had let go all holds and degenerated
to this heartless occupation of common gambler?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>True to Slip, he had watched the river for the stranger
whose inquiries had been carried down in fair warning
to all the river people&mdash;and Buck, suddenly conscious
of his own part in that river system, laughed in surprise.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;humans are faithful
to one another! It&#8217;s what they live for, to be faithful
to one another!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was an incredible, but undeniable theory. In
spite of his own wilful disbelief in the faith of mankind,
here he was sitting by one poor devil&#8217;s bed
while he kept his weather eye out upon the rough river
in the interests of another&mdash;a murderer! He pondered
on the question of whether any one kept faith with him.
His mind cried out angrily, &#8220;No!&#8221; but on second
thought, in spite of himself, he realized distinctly that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
he had let one person&#8217;s faithlessness overcome his trust
of all others.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No day on the Mississippi is longer than the cold,
bleak monotone of a dry gale out of the north. There
is an undertone to the voices which depresses the soul
as the rank wind shrivels the body. On whistling
wings great flocks of wild fowl come driving down before
the wintry gales, or they turn back from the prospect of
an early spring. Steamboats are driven into the refuge
of landing or eddy, and if the power craft cannot stand
the buffetings, much less are the exposed little houseboats,
toys of current and breeze, able to escape the resistless
blasts. So the wind possesses itself of the whole
river breadth and living creatures are driven to shelter.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Prebol, shot through and conscious of the reward of
his manner of living; Slip, a fugitive under the menace
of a murderer&#8217;s fate; and Buck, given over to melancholy,
were but types on the lengths and tributaries of
the indifferent flood.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nothing happened, nothing could happen. The
arrival of Slip from his restless bunk relieved Buck of
his vigil, and he went to bed and slept into the dawn of
another day&mdash;a day like the previous one, and fit to
drive him up the bank, into the woods, and among the
fallen branches of rotten trees seeking in physical activity
to check the mourning and tauntings of a mind
over which he found, as often before, that he had no
control.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>And yet, when the storm suddenly blew itself out
with a light puff and a sudden flood of sunshine, just
as the sun went down, Prebol&#8217;s condition took a sudden
turn for the better, Slip forgot his fears, and Buck burst
into a gay little whistled tune, which he could never
whistle except when he was absurdly and inexplicably
merry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon&#8217;s notebooks held tens of thousands
of words describing the Mississippi River
and the people he had met. He had drifted
down long, lonely bends, and he had surprised a flock
of wild geese under a little bluff on an island sandbar
just above Kaskaskia, in the big cut-off there. Until
this day the Mississippi had been growing more and
more into his consciousness; not people, not industries,
not corn, wheat, or cotton had become interesting and
important, but the yellow flood itself.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His thought had been, when he left St. Louis, to stop
in towns and gather those things which minds not of
the newspaper profession lump under the term of
&#8220;histories,&#8221; but now, after his hundreds of miles of
association with the river, his thought took but brief
note of those trifling and inconspicuous appearances
known as &#8220;river towns.&#8221; He had passed by many
places with hardly a glance, so entrancing had been the
prospect of endless miles of earth-bound flood!&mdash;bound
but wearing away its bonds.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Now, in one of the most picturesque of all the scenes
he had witnessed, in the historic double bend above
New Madrid, he found himself with a young and attractive
woman. He realized that, in some way, the
Mississippi River &#8220;spirit&#8221;&mdash;as he always quoted it in
his calm and dispassionate remarks and dissertations
and descriptions&mdash;had encompassed him about, and,
without giving him any choice, had tied him down to
what in all the societies he had ever known would have
been called a &#8220;compromising position.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>That morning he had left the husband of this pretty
girl lying in a drunken stupor, and now in the late evening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
the fugitive wife was taking it for granted that
he would dine with her on her boat&mdash;and he had himself
entered upon a partnership with her for that meal
which could not by any possibility be called prosaic
or commonplace. He had a vivid recollection of having
visited a girl back home&mdash;he thought the phrase
with difficulty&mdash;and he remembered the word &#8220;chaperon&#8221;
as from a foreign language, or at least from an
obsolete and forgotten age.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His familiarity with newspaper work did not relieve
him of a feeling of uncertainty. In fact, it emphasized
the questionableness of the occasion. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you
I&#8217;m a dandy cook,&#8221; she had said, and while he followed
her on board the boat, with the two big black ducks to
help prepare, he wondered and remembered and, in
spite of his life-long avoidance of all appearance of evil,
submitted to this irresistible circumstance, wherever
it might lead.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So he built the fire in her kitchen stove. She mixed
up dressing and seasoned the birds, made biscuit batter
for hot-bread, brought out stacks and stores of things
to eat, or to eat with, and they set the table, ground the
coffee, and got the oven hot for the roasting and baking.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>One thing took the curse off their position: They
had to have all the windows and doors wide open so
that they seemed fairly to be cooking on an open sandbar
at the edge of the river. Terabon took an inward
satisfaction in that fact. It is not possible to feel exceedingly
wicked or depraved when there is a mile-wide
Mississippi on the one hand and a mile-wide
sandbar on the other side, and the sun is shining calmly
upon the bright and innocent waters.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As the ducks were young and tender, their cooking
took but an hour, or a little more, and the interim was
occupied in the countless things that must be done to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
prepare even a shanty-boat feast. He stirred some
cranberry sauce, and she had to baste the ducks, get
the flour stirred with water, and condensed cream for
gravy, besides setting the table and raising the biscuits,
to have them ready for the ducks. She must needs
wonder if she&#8217;d forgotten the salt, and for ten minutes
she was almost in a panic at the thought, while he
watched her in breathless wonderment, and took covert
glances up the Mississippi River, fearful of, and yet
almost wishing to see, that pursuing motorboat come
into view.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When at last the smoking viands were on the ample
table and they sat with their knees under it, and he
began to carve the ducks and dish out the unblessed
meal, he glanced up stream through the cabin window
on his right. He caught a glimpse of a window pane
flashing miles distant in the light of the setting sun&mdash;the
whiskey boat without doubt. He saw a flock of ducks
coming like a great serpent just above the river surface,
then a shadow lifted as out of the river, swept up the
trees in the lost section of Kentucky opposite, and from
spattering gold the scene turned to blue which rapidly
became purple, darkening visibly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Through the open doors and windows swept the
chill of twilight, and while she lighted the big lamp
he did her bidding and closed the doors and windows.
Those shelves of books, classics and famous, time-tried
fiction, leered at him from their racks. The gold of
titles, the blues and reds and greens of covers fairly
mocked him, and he saw himself struggling with the
menace of sin; he saw an honourable career and carefully
nurtured ambition fading from view, for did not
all those master minds warn the young against evil?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>But they talked over the ducks of what a pity it was
that all towns could not engage themselves in thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
the way Athens used to do, and they wondered to each
other when the hurrying passion of greed and its varying
phenomena would become reconciled to a modest
competence and the simplicity which they, for example,
were enjoying down the Mississippi.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When he looked up from his meat sometimes he
caught her eyes looking at him. He recognized her
superiority of experience and position; she made him
feel like a boy, but a boy of whom she was really quite
fond, or at least in whom she was interested. For that
feeling he was grateful, though there was something in
her smile which led him to doubt his own success in
veiling or hiding the doubts or qualms which had,
unbidden, risen in his thoughts at the equivocal nature
of their position.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Having dined on the best meal he had had since leaving
home, they talked a little while over the remains of
the sumptuous repast. But their mood grew silent,
and they kept up the conversation with difficulty.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better put up my canvas top,&#8221; he blurted
out, and she assented.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And then you must come back and help me wash
this awful pile of dishes,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, of course!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help with the canvas,&#8221; she said, and he dared
not look at her.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>By the light of his lantern they put up the canvas
to protect the boat from dew. Then they looked
around at the night; stars overhead, the strange haze
from the countless grains of sand which wavered over
the bar, and the river in the dark, running by.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They looked at the river together, and they felt its
majesty, its power, its resistlessness.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s overwhelming,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;When you
can&#8217;t see it you hear it, or you feel it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And it makes everything else seem so small, so unimportant,
so perfectly negligible,&#8221; she added, consciously,
and then with vivacity: &#8220;I&#8217;ll not make you
wipe those dishes, after all. But you must take me
for a walk up this sandbar!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Gladly,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll help with the dishes
as well!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She put on a jacket, pinned on a cap, and together,
in merry mood, they romped up the sandbar. It was
all sand; there was not a log of timber, not a drift barrel,
not a stick of wood anywhere as far as they could
see. But as they walked along every foot of the
sandbar was different, wind-rifts, covering long, water-shaped
reefs; or rising knolls, like hills, and long depressions
which held shadows darker by far than the gloom
of the night. They walked along, sometimes yards
apart, sometimes side by side. They forgot Ruskin
and Carlyle&mdash;they remembered Thoreau&#8217;s &#8220;Cape Cod&#8221;
and talked of the musical sands which they could hear
now under their own feet. In the silence they heard
river voices; murmurings and tones and rhythms and
harmonies; and Terabon, who had accumulated a vast
store of information from the shanty-boaters, told her
some of the simple superstitions with which the river
people beguile themselves and add to the interest and
difficulties of their lives.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;An old river man can look at the river and tell
when a headrise is coming,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;He knows
by the looks of the water when the river is due to
fall again. When he dreams, he says he knows what is
going to happen, and where to find buried treasure, and
if there is going to be an earthquake or a bad storm.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They get queer living alone!&#8221; she said, thoughtfully.
&#8220;Lots of them used to stop in at our slough
on Kaw River. I was afraid of them!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You afraid of anything!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Of any
one!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, that was a long time ago&mdash;ages ago!&#8221; She
laughed, and then gave voice to that most tragic riverside
thought. &#8220;But now&mdash;nothing at all matters
now!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She said it with an intonation which was almost relief
and laughing, that Terabon, whose mind had grappled
for years with one of Ruskin&#8217;s most touching
phrases, understood how it could be that the heart of a
human being could become so used to sorrows that no
misery could bring tears.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He knew in that very moment, as by revelation, that
he had caught from her lips one of the bitterest phrases
which the human mind is capable of forming. He was
glad of the favour which fate had bestowed upon him,
and he thrilled, while he regretted, that in that hour he
could not forget that he was a seeker of facts, a gatherer
of information.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>To match her mood was beyond his own power.
By a simple statement of fact she had given herself a
place in his thought comparable to&mdash;he went at making
ideas again, despite himself&mdash;comparable to one of
those wonderful widows which are the delight, while
they rend to tatters the ambitions of delvers into
the mysteries of Olympian lore. This bright, pretty,
vivacious young woman had suffered till she had arrived
at a Helen&#8217;s recklessness&mdash;nothing mattered!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There was a pause.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I think you are in a fair way to become unforgetable
in connection with the Mississippi River,&#8221; he suggested,
with even voice.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded, quickly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; with the semblance of perfect
frankness. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering which one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
Grecian goddesses you would have been if you had
lived, say, in Homer&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Which one of them I resemble?&#8221; she asked, amused.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Exactly that,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s such a pretty compliment,&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;It fits so well into the things I&#8217;ve been thinking. The
river grows and grows on me, and I feel as though I
grew with it! You don&#8217;t know&mdash;you could never know&mdash;you&#8217;re
a man&mdash;masculine! For the first time in my
life I&#8217;m free&mdash;and&mdash;and I don&#8217;t&mdash;I don&#8217;t care a damn!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But the future!&#8221; he protested, feebly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;For a river goddess
there is no future. It&#8217;s all in the present for her, because
she is eternal.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They had walked clear up to the southernmost tip
of the sandbar point. They could hear someone, perhaps
a chorus of voices, singing on the whiskey boat
at the Upper Landing. They could see the light of the
boat&#8217;s windows. There they turned and started back
down the sandbar, reaching the two boats moored side
by side in the deadwater.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Shall I help with those dishes to-night?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ll do them in the morning,&#8221; she replied
without emphasis and as a matter of course, which
left him unassisted in his obvious predicament.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he drawled, after a time, &#8220;it&#8217;s about midnight.
I must say a river goddess is&mdash;is beyond my
most vivid dreams. I wonder&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What do you wonder?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let me kiss you good-night now?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The stars twinkled as he put his arm around her
and took the kiss which her lips gave&mdash;smiling.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help with those dishes in the morning,&#8221; he said,
helping her up the gang plank of her boat. &#8220;Good-night!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; she answered, and entered the cabin,
the dim light of her turned-down lamp flashing across
the sandbar and revealing his face for a moment.
Then the door closed between them.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He went to his skiff, raised the cover, and crawled
into his canvas hammock which was swung from both
sides of his boat. Before going to sleep he looked under
the canvas at the river, at the stars, at the dark cabin-boat
forty feet distant in the eddy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>At the same moment he saw a face against a window
pane in the cabin.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; he asked himself, but there
was no answer. The river, when asked, seldom answers.
Just as he was about to go to sleep, he started
up, wide awake.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For the first time on the river, he had forgotten to
post up his notes. He felt that he had come that day,
as never before, to the forks in the road&mdash;when he must
choose between the present and the future. He
lighted his lantern, sat up in his cot, and reached for
his typewriter.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He wrote steadily, at full speed, for an hour. When
he had those wonderful and fleeting thoughts and
observations nailed down and safe, he again put out his
lantern, and turned in once more.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then he heard a light, gay laugh, clear and distinct-a
river voice beyond question&mdash;full of raillery, and yet
beneath the mocking note was something else which
he could neither identify nor analyze, which he hoped
was not scorn or mere derision, which he wished might
be understanding and sympathy&mdash;till he thought of
his making those notes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then he despised himself, which was really good for
his soul. His conscience, instead of rejoicing, rebuked
him as a cad. He swore under his breath.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Augustus Carline was a long time recovering
even his consciousness. A thousand dreams,
a thousand nightmares tormented his thoughts
while the mangling grip of unnumbered vises and ropes
sank deep into his flesh; ploughs and harrows dragged
through his twisted muscles.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Yet he did rise at last out of his pit and, leaning
against the cabin of his boat, look about him to see
what hell he had escaped into. The sun was shining
somewhere, blinding his eyes, which were already
seared. A river coiled by, every ripple a blistering
white flame. He heard birds and other music which
sounded like an anvil chorus performing in the narrow
confines of a head as large as a cabin.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He remembered something. It was even worse than
what he was undergoing, but he could not quite call
the horror to the surface of the weltering sea of his
feelings; he did not even know his name, nor his place,
nor any detail except the present pain&mdash;and he didn&#8217;t
want to know. He fought against knowing, till the
thing pressed exuberantly forward, and then he knew
that the beautiful girl, the woman he loved and to
whom he was married, had left him. That was the
exquisite calamity of his soul, and he flinched from the
fact as from a blow. He was always flinching, he
remembered. He was always turning from the uncomfortable
and the bothering to seek what was easy
and unengaging. Now, for the moment, he could not
undertake any relief from his present misery.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Acres and lakes of water were flowing by, but his
thirst was worse than oceans could quench. He wanted
to drink, but the thought of drinking disgusted him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
beyond measure. It seemed to him that a drop of
water would flame up in his throat like gasolene on a
bed of coals, and at that moment his eyes fell upon the
jug which stood by the misty engine against the intangible
locker. The jug was a monument of comfort
and substantiality.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>At the odour which filled the air when he had taken
out the cork his very soul was filled with horror.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But I got to drink it!&#8221; he whimpered. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
only thing that&#8217;ll cure me, the only thing I can stand.
If I don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll die!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Not to drink was suicide, and to drink was living
death! He could not choose between the suggestions;
he never had been trained to face fate manfully.
His years&#8217; long dissipation had unfitted him for every
squarely made decision, and now with horror on one
side and terror on the other, he could not procrastinate
and wonder what folly had brought him to this state.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t it smell good!&#8221; he choked. &#8220;The
taste&#8217;ll kill me!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Taste he must, or perish! The taste was all that
he had anticipated, and melted iron could hardly have
been more painful than that first torture of cold, fusil
acid. Gulping it down, he was willing to congratulate
himself on his endurance and wisdom, his very heroism
in undertaking that deadly specific.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>After it was over with, however, the raw chill, which
the heat of the sun did not help, began to yield to a glow
of warmth. He straightened his twisted muscles and
after a hasty look around retreated into his cabin and
flung himself on his bunk.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>What length of time he spent in his recovery from
the attacks of his enemy, or rather enemies of a misspent
youth, he could not surmise. He did at last stir
from his place and look with subdued melancholy into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
a world of woe. He recalled the visitor, the man who
wrote for newspapers, and in a panic he searched for
his money.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The money was gone; $250, at least, had disappeared
from his pockets. An empty wallet on the cabin floor
showed with what contemptuous calm the funds had
been abstracted from his pockets. He turned, however,
to a cunning little hiding place, and found there
his main supply of currency&mdash;a thousand dollars or
more.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No man likes to be robbed, and Carline, fixing upon
his visitor Terabon as his assailant, worked himself
into a fine frenzy of indignation. The fellow had purposely
encouraged him to drink immoderately&mdash;Carline&#8217;s
memory was clear and unmistaken on that point&mdash;and
then, taking advantage of his unconsciousness,
the pseudo writer had committed piracy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;d ought to be glad he didn&#8217;t kill me!&#8221; Carline
sneered to himself, looking around to conjure up the
things that might have been.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The prospect was far from pleasing. The sky was
dark, although it was clearly sometime near the middle
of a day&mdash;what day, he could but guess. The wind was
raw and penetrating, howling through the trees, and
skipping down the chute with a quick rustling of low,
breaking waves. The birds and animals which he had
heard were gone with the sunshine.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When Carline took another look over his boat, he
found that it had been looted of many things, including
a good blanket, his shot gun and rifle, ammunition,
and most of his food supply&mdash;though he could not recall
that he had had much food on board.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He lighted the coal-oil heater to warm the cabin,
for he was chilled to the bone. He threw the jug overboard,
bound now never again to touch another drop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
of liquor as long as he lived&mdash;that is, unless he happened
to want a drink.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Wearily he set about cleaning up his boat. He was
naturally rather inclined to neatness and orderliness.
He picked up, folded, swept out, and put into shape. He
appeased his delicate appetite with odds and ends of
things from a locker full of canned goods which had
escaped the looter.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As long as he could, Carline had not engaged his
thoughts with the subject of his runaway wife. Now,
his mind clearing and his body numb, his soul took up
the burden again, and he felt his helplessness thrice
confounded. He did not mind anything now compared
to the one fact that he had lost and deserved to lose
the respect of the pretty girl who had become his
wife. He took out the photographs which he had of
her, and looked at them, one by one. What a fool he
had been, and what a scoundrel he was!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He could not give over the pursuit, however; he felt
that he must save her from herself; he must seek and
rescue her. He hoisted in his anchor and starting the
motor, turned into the chute and ran down before the
wind into the river. Never had he seen the Mississippi
in such a dark and repellent mood.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When he had cleared the partial shelter of Island No.
8, he felt the wind and current at the stern of his boat,
driving it first one way then the other. Steering was
difficult, and fear began to clutch at his heart. He felt
his helplessness and the hopelessness of his search down
that wide river with its hundred thousand hiding places.
He knew nothing of the gossiping river people except
that he despised them. He could not dream that his
ignorance of things five or ten miles from his home was
not typical of the shanty-boaters; he could not know that
where he was a stranger in the next township to his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
home, a shanty-boater would know the landing place of
his friends a thousand miles or so down stream.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Without maps, without knowledge, without instinct,
he might almost as well have been blind. His careless,
ignorant glance swept the eight or nine miles of shoreline
of sandbar from above Island No. 10 clear down to
the fresh sloughing above Hotchkiss&#8217;s Landing, opposite
the dry Winchester Chute&mdash;in which deep-draft gun-barges
had been moored fifty years or so before. He
did not even know it was Island No. 10, Donaldson&#8217;s
Point; he didn&#8217;t know that he was leaving Kentucky to
skirt Tennessee; much less did he dream that he was
passing Kentucky again. He looked at a shanty-boat
moored at the foot of a mile-long sandbar; saw, without
observing, a skiff against the bar just above the cabined
scow. His gaze discovered smoke, houses, signs
of settlement miles below, and he quickened the beat
of his motor to get down there.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He longed for people, for humanity, for towns and
cities; and that was a big sawmill and cotton-gin town
ahead of him, silhouetted along the top of a high bank.
He headed straight for it, and found his boat inexplicably
slowed up and rebuffed. Strangers on the river
always do find themselves baffled by the big New Madrid
eddy, which even power boats engage with difficulty
of management. He landed at last against a
floating dock, and found that it was a fish market.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Having made fast, he went up town and spent hours,
till long after dark, buying supplies, talking to people,
getting the lonesomeness out of his system, and making
veiled inquiries to learn if anything had been heard
about a woman coming down the Mississippi. He succeeded
in giving the impression that he was a detective.
In the restaurant he talked with a cocky little
bald-headed man all spruced up and dandyish.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m from Pittsburgh,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;My name&#8217;s
Doss, Ronald Doss; I&#8217;m a sportsman, but every winter
I drop down here, hunting and fishing; sometimes on
the river, sometimes back in the bottoms. I suppose,
Mr. Carline, that you&#8217;re a stranger on the river?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, yes-s, down this way; I live near it, up at
Gage.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I see, your first trip down. Got a nice gasolene
boat, though!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, yes! You&#8217;re stopping here?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Just arrived this morning; trying to make up my
mind whether I&#8217;ll go over on St. Francis, turkey-and
deer-hunting, or get a boat and drop down the Mississippi.
Been wondering about that.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well, say, now&mdash;why can&#8217;t you drop down with me?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d be in the way&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Not a bit&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Costs a lot to run a motorboat, and I&#8217;d have to&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, you wouldn&#8217;t! Not a cent! Your experience
and my boat&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Well, of course, if you put it that way. If it&#8217;d be
any accommodation to you to have an old river man&mdash;I
mean I&#8217;ve always tripped the river, off and on, for sport.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;d be an education for me, a great help!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, I expect it would be an education, if you don&#8217;t
know the river.&#8221; Doss smiled.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They walked over to the river bank. An arc light
cast its rays upon the end of the street, down the sloping
bank, and in a light circle upon the rocking, muddy
waters where the fish dock and several shanty-boats
rested against the bank.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Doss whistled a little tune as he rested on his cane.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The front door of the third houseboat up the eddy
opened and closed. A man climbed the bank and
passed the two with a basket on his arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Come on down,&#8221; Carline urged.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Not to-night,&#8221; Doss said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my room up
at the hotel, and I&#8217;ll have to get my stuff out of the
railroad baggage room. But I&#8217;ll come down about 10
or 11 o&#8217;clock in the morning. Then we&#8217;ll fit up and
drop down the river. Good-night!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Doss watched Carline go down to the dock and on to
his boat. Then he went up the street and held earnest
confab with a man who had a basket on his arm. They
whispered ten minutes or so, then the man with the
basket returned to his shanty-boat, and within half an
hour was back up town, carrying two suitcases, a gun
case, and a duffle bag.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Doss went to the smaller hotel with these things and
registered. He walked down to the river in the morning
and noticed that the third shanty-boat had dropped
out into the river during the night, in spite of the storm
that was blowing up. He went down and ate breakfast
with Carline, and the two went up and got Doss&#8217;s
outfit at the hotel. They returned to the motorboat,
and, having laid in a supply of groceries, cast off their
lines and steered away down the river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir, we&#8217;ll find that girl if it takes all winter!&#8221; the
fish-market man heard Doss tell Carline in a loud voice.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>That afternoon a man in a skiff came down the
river and turned into the dock. As he landed, the
fish-market man said to him:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Yes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;If you see any lady coming down, tell her a detector
is below, lookin&#8217; fo&#8217; her. He&#8217;s a cheap skate, into a motorboat&mdash;but
I don&#8217;t expect he&#8217;ll be into hit long, &#8217;count of
some river fellers bein&#8217; with him. But he mout be bad,
that detector. If you should see a nice lady, tell her.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; the skiff man, who was Lester Terabon,
exclaimed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For long hours Parson Rasba endured the drifting
sand and the biting wind which penetrated
the weather-cracks in his poplar shanty-boat.
It was not until near nightfall that it dawned on him
that he need not remain there, that it was the simplest
thing in the world to let go his hold and blow before the
wind till he was clear of the sandblast.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He did haul in his anchor and float away. As he
rode the waves and danced before the wind the clouds
of sand were flung swiftly down upon the water, where
the surface was covered with a film and a sheet of dust.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Standing at his sweeps, he saw that he was approaching
the head of another sandbar, and as he felt the
water shoaling under the boat he cast over the anchor
and rode in clear air again. He was not quite without
a sense of humour.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Shaking the dust out of his long hair and combing it
out of his whiskers, he laughed at his ignorance and lack
of resource. He swept the decks and floor of his cabin,
and scooped the sand up with an ash shovel to throw
overboard. A lesson learned on the Mississippi is
part of the education of the future&mdash;if there is anything
in the pupil&#8217;s head to hold a memory of a fact or experience.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Even though he knew it was his own ignorance that
had kept him a prisoner in that storm, Parson Rasba
did not fail to realize that his ignorance had been sin,
and that his punishment was due to his absorption in
the fate of a pretty woman.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Certainly after such a sharp rebuke he could not
fail to return to his original task, imposed upon him
because of his fault in bringing the feud fighters of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
home mountains together, untrained and unrepentant,
to hear the voice of his pride declare the Word for the
edification of sinners. Parson Rasba did not mince
his words as he contemplated the joy he had felt in
being eloquent and a &#8220;power&#8221; of a speaker from the
pulpits of the mountain churches. The murdering by
the feud fighters had taught him what he would never
forget, and his frank acknowledgment of each rebuke
gave him greater understanding.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>While the gale lasted he watched the river and the
sky. The wild fowl flying low, and dropping into
woods behind him led to forays seeking game, and in a
bayou a mile distant he drew down with deadly aim on
one of a flock of geese. He killed that bird, and then as
its startled and lumbering mates sought flight, he got
two more of them, missing another shot or two in the
excitement.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The three great birds made a load for him, and he
returned to his boat with a heart lighter than he had
known in many a day because it seemed to him a
&#8220;sign&#8221; that he need not hate himself overmuch. The
river consoled him, and its constancy and integrity
were an example which he could not help but take to
heart.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Gales might blow, fair weather might tempt, islands
might interpose themselves in its way, banks and sandbars
might stand against the flood, but come what
might, the river poured on through its destined course
like a human life.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He entertained the whimsical fancy, as his smallest
goose was roasting, that perhaps the Mississippi might
sin. In so many ways the river reminded him of humankind.
He had stood beside a branch of the Mississippi
which was so small and narrow that he could
dam it with his ample foot, or scoop it up with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
bucket&mdash;and yet here it was a mile wide! In its youth it was
subject to the control of trifling things, a stone or a log,
or the careless handiwork of a man. Down here all
the little threads of its being had united in a full tide
of life still subject to the influences of its normal course,
but wearing and tearing along beyond any power to
stop till its appointed course was run.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Insensibly Parson Rasba felt the resources of his
own mind flocking to help him. Just being there beside
that mighty torrent helped him to get a perspective
on things. Tiny things seemed so useless in the
front of that overwhelming power. What were the
big things of his own life? What were the important
affairs of his existence?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He could not tell. He had always meant to do the
right thing. He could see now, looking back on his
life, that his good intentions had not prevented his ignorance
from precipitating a feud fight.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I should have taken them, family by family, and
brought them to their own knees fustest,&#8221; he thought,
grimly. &#8220;Then I could have helt &#8217;em all together in
mutual repentance!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Having arrived at that idea, he shrugged his shoulders
almost self-contemptuously. &#8220;I&#8217;m a learnin&#8217;.
That&#8217;s one consolation, I&#8217;m a learnin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>And then Rasba heard the Call!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was Old Mississip&#8217;s voice; the river was heaping
duties upon him more and more. So far, he had
been rather looking out for himself, now he recalled
the houseboats which he had seen moored down the
reaches and in the bends. Those river people, dropping
down incessantly with the river current, must sometimes
need help, comfort, and perhaps advice. His
humility would not permit him to think that he could
preach to them or exhort them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Man to man, likely I could he&#8217;p some po&#8217;r sinner
see as much as I can see. If I could kind of get &#8217;em
to see what this big, old riveh is like! Hit&#8217;s carryin&#8217;
a leaf er a duck, an&#8217; steamboats an&#8217; shanty-bo&#8217;ts;

no man it&#8217;s he&#8217;p if he comes to it to float down
a log raft er a million bushels of coal. If Ole Mississip&#8217;ll
do that fo&#8217; anybody, suttin&#8217;ly hit&#8217;s clear an&#8217; plain
that God won&#8217;t deny a sinner His he&#8217;p! Yas, suh!
Now I&#8217;ve shore found a handle to keep hold of my religion!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Peace of mind had come to him, but not the peace
of indolence and neglect. Far from that! He saw
years of endless endeavour opening before him, but
not with multitudes looking up to him as he stood, grand
and noble, in the bright light of a thousand pulpits, circuit
riding the earth. Instead, he would go to a sinning
man here, a sorrowing woman there, and perhaps
sit down with a little child, to give it comfort and instruction.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>People were too scattered down the Mississippi
to think of congregations. All days were Sunday,
and for him there could be no day of rest. If he could
not do big work, at least he could meet men and women,
and he could get to know little children, to understand
their needs. He knew it was a good thought, and when
he looked across the Mississippi, he saw night coming
on, but between him and the dark was sunset.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The cold white glare changed to brilliant colours;
clouds whose gray-blue had oppressed the soul of the
mountain man flashed red and purple, growing thinner
and thinner, and when he had gazed for a minute at
the glow of a fixed government light he was astonished
by the darkness of night&mdash;only the night was filled with
stars.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Thus the river, the weather, the climate, the sky,
the sandbars, and the wooded banks revealed themselves
in changing moods and varying lights to the
mountain man whose life had always been pent in
and narrowed, without viewpoint or a sense of the
future. The monster size of the river dwarfed the
little affairs of his own life and humbled the pride which
had so often been humbled before. At last he began
to look down on himself, seeing something of the true
relation of his importance to the immeasurable efforts
of thousands and millions of men.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The sand clouds carried by the north wind must
ever remain an epoch in his experience. Definitely
he was rid of a great deal of nonsense, ignorance, and
pride; at the same time it seemed, somehow, to have
grounded him on something much firmer and broader
than the vanities of his youth.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His eyes searched the river in the dark for some place
to begin his work, and as they did so, he discovered a
bright, glaring light a few miles below him across the
sandbar at the head of which he had anchored. He
saw other lights down that way, a regular settlement of
lights across the river, and several darting firefly
gleams in the middle of the stream which he recognized
were boats, probably small gasolene craft.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In forty minutes he was dipping his sweep blades to
work his way into the eddy where several small passenger
craft were on line-ends from a large, substantial
craft which was brightly lighted by lanterns and a
big carbide light. Its windows were aglow with cheeriness,
and the occupants engaged in strange pastimes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Come, now, come on, now!&#8221; someone was crying

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
strain he put on the sweeps made them squeak. The
splash of oars down the current was heard by people
on board and several walked out on the deck.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Whoe-e-e!&#8221; one hailed. &#8220;Who all mout yo&#8217; be?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Rasba!&#8221; the newcomer replied. &#8220;Parson Elijah
Rasba, suh. Out of the Ohio!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hi-i-i!&#8221; a listener cried out, gleefully, &#8220;hyar comes
the Riveh Prophet after yo sinners. Hi-i-i!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There was a laugh through the crowd. Others
strolled out to see the phenomenon. A man who had
been playing with fortune at one of the poker tables
swore aloud.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I cayn&#8217;t neveh git started, I don&#8217;t shift down on my
luck!&#8221; he whined. &#8220;Las&#8217; time, jes&#8217; when I was coming
home, I see a piebald mewl, an&#8217; now hyar comes a parson.
Dad drat this yeah ole riveh! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to quit.
I&#8217;m gwine to go to Hot Springs!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>These casual asides were as nothing, however, to the
tumult that stirred in the soul of Jock Drones, who had
been cutting bread to make boiled-ham sandwiches for
their patrons that night. His acute hearing had picked
up the sound of the coming shanty-boat, and he had
felt the menace of a stranger dropping in after dark.
Few men not on mischief bent, or determined to run
all night, run into shanty-boat eddies.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He even turned down the light a little, and looked
toward the door to see if the way was clear. The hail
relieved the tension of his mind strain, but only for a
minute. Then he heard that answer.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Rasba!&#8221; he heard. &#8220;Parson Elijah Rasba, suh.
Out of the Ohio!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In a flash he knew the truth! Old Rasba, whose
preaching he had listened to that bloody night away
up in the mountains, had come down the rivers. A
parson, none else, was camping on the mountain fugitive&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
trail. That meant tribulation, that meant the
inescapableness of sin&#8217;s punishment&mdash;not in jails, not
in trial courts, not on the gallows, but worse than that!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Come abo&#8217;d, Parson!&#8221; someone shouted, and the
boats bumped. There was a scramble to make a line
fast, and then the trampling of many feet, as the
Prophet was introduced to that particular river hell,
amid stifled cries of expectancy and murmurs of warning.
Next to being raided by the sheriff of an adjacent
county, having a river prophet come on board is the
greatest excitement and the smartest amusement of
the bravados down the river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hyar&#8217;s the Prophet!&#8221; a voice shouted. &#8220;Now git
ready fo&#8217; yo&#8217; eternal damnation. See &#8217;im gather hisse&#8217;f!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba gathering himself! Jock could not help but
take a peep. It was Rasba, gaunt, tall, his head up
close to the shanty-boat roof and his shoulders nearly
a head higher than the collars of most of those men who
stood by with insolence and doubtful good humour.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Which&#8217;d yo&#8217; rather git to play, Parson?&#8221; someone
asked, slyly. &#8220;Cyards er bones er pull-sticks?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a friend down yeah, gentlemen.&#8221; The Prophet
ignored the insult. &#8220;His mother wants him. She&#8217;s
afeared likely he mout forget, since he was jes&#8217; a boy
friendly and needing friends. He&#8217;s no runt, no triflin&#8217;
no-&#8217;count, puppy man, like this thing,&#8221; in the direction
whence the invitation had come, &#8220;but tall an&#8217; square,
an&#8217; honourable, near six foot, an&#8217; likely 160 pounds.
Not like this little runt thing yeah, but a real man!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There was a yell of approval and delight.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Who all mout yo&#8217; friend be?&#8221; Buck asked, respectfully,
seeing that this was not a raid, but a visit.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Jock, suh, Jock Drones, his mammy wants him,
suh!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Buck eyed the visitor keenly for a minute. Someone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
said they never had heard of him. Buck, who saw that
the visitor was in mind to turn back, suggested:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Won&#8217;t yo&#8217; have a cup of coffee, suh? Hit&#8217;s raw
outside to-night, fresh and mean. Give him a chair,
boys! I&#8217;m friendly with any man who takes a message
from a mother to her wandering son.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A dozen chairs were snatched out to the stove, and
when Parson Rasba had accepted one, Buck stepped
into the kitchen. He found Slip, <i>alias</i> Jock Drones,
standing with beads of sweat on his forehead. No need
to ask the first question; Buck poured out a cup of coffee
and said:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What&#8217;ll I tell him, Slip?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I cayn&#8217;t go back, Buck!&#8221; Slip whimpered. &#8220;Hit&#8217;s
a hanging crime!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Something may have changed,&#8221; Buck suggested.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, suh, I&#8217;ve heard. Hit were my bullet&mdash;I&#8217;ve
heard. Hit&#8217;s a trial, an&#8217; hit&#8217;s&mdash;hit&#8217;s hanging!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sh-h! Not so loud!&#8221; Buck warned. &#8220;If it&#8217;s lawyer
money you need?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I got &#8217;leven hundred, an&#8217; a trial lawyer&#8217;ll cost only
a thousand, Buck! Yo&#8217;s a friend&mdash;Lawse! I&#8217;d shore
like to talk to him. He&#8217;s no detector, Parson Rasba
yain&#8217;t. Why, he&#8217;s be&#8217;n right into a stillhouse, drunk
the moonshine&mdash;an&#8217; no revenue hearn of hit, the way
some feared. My sister wrote me. I want to talk to
him, Buck, but&mdash;but not let them outside know.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix it,&#8221; Buck promised, carrying out steaming
coffee, a plate of sandwiches, and two big oranges for
the parson.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He returned, filled up the trays for the others, and
took them out. Soon the crowd were sitting around, or
leaning against the heavy crap table, talking and listening.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yo&#8217; come way down from the mountangs to find a

better than his words how well he understood the sacrifice
of that journey.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s seo,&#8221; Rasba nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;m partly to blame,
myse&#8217;f, for his coming down. I was a mountain
preacher, exhorter, and I &#8217;lowed I knowed hit all.
One candlelight I had a congregation an&#8217; I hit &#8217;er up
loud that night, an&#8217; I &#8217;lowed I&#8217;d done right smart
with those people&#8217;s souls. But&mdash;but hit were no such
thing. This boy, Jock, he runned away that night,
&#8217;count of my foolishness, an&#8217; we know he&#8217;s down thisaway;
if I could git to find him, his mammy&#8217;d shore be
comforted. She&#8217;s a heap more faith in me&#8217;n I have,
but I come down yeah. Likely I couldn&#8217;t do much for
that boy, but I kin show I&#8217;d like to.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Trippin&#8217; a thousand miles shows some intrust!&#8221;
somebody said.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I lived all my life up theh in the mountangs, an&#8217;
hit&#8217;s God&#8217;s country, gem&#8217;men! This yeah&mdash;&#8221; he
glanced around him till his glance fell upon the card

of cards and packets of dice and shaker boxes&mdash;&#8220;this
yeah, sho! Hit ain&#8217;t God&#8217;s country, gem&#8217;men! Hit&#8217;s

haul to-night! But I live yeah now!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Buck, who had been coming and going, had stopped
at the parson&#8217;s voice. He did not laugh, he did not even
smile. The point was not missed, however. Far from
it! He went out, bowed by the truth of it, and in the
kitchen he looked at Slip, who was sitting in black and
silent consideration of that cry, carried far in the echoes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;re one of us, Parson!&#8221; a voice exclaimed in disbelief.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh,&#8221; Rasba smiled as he looked into the man&#8217;s
eyes, &#8220;I&#8217;m one of you. I &#8217;low we uns&#8217;ll git thar together,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
&#8217;cordin&#8217; as we die. Look! This gem&#8217;men gives
me bread an&#8217; meat; he quenches my thirst, too. An&#8217;
I take hit out&#8217;n his hands. &#8217;Peahs like he owns this
boat!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh,&#8221; someone affirmed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Then I shall not shake hit&#8217;s dust off my feet when
I go,&#8221; Rasba declared, sharply. Buck stared; Rasba
did not look at even his shoes; Buck caught his breath.
Whatever Rasba meant, whatever the other listeners
understood, Buck felt and broke beneath those statements
which brought to him things that he never had
known before.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not shake the dust of this gambling dive from
his feet!&#8221; Buck choked under his breath. &#8220;And this
is how far down I&#8217;ve got!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba, conscious only of his own shortcomings, had
no idea that he had fired shot after shot, let alone
landed shell after shell. He knew only that the men
sat in respectful, drawn-faced silence. He wondered if
they were not sorry for him, a preacher, who had fallen
so far from his circuit riding and feastings and meetings
in churches. It did not occur to him that these men
knew they were wicked, and that they were suffering
from his unintentional but overwhelming rebuke.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They turned away impatiently, and went in their
boats to the village landing across the river; a night&#8217;s
sport spoiled for them by the coming of a luck-breaking
parson. Others waited to hear more of what they knew
they needed, partly in amusement, partly in curiosity,
and partly because they liked the whiskery fellow who
was so interesting. At the same time, what he said
was stinging however inoffensive.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Game&#8217;s closed for the night!&#8221; Buck announced,
and the gamesters took their departure. They made
no protest, for it was not feasible to continue gambling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
when everyone knows a parson brings bad luck to a
player.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The outside lights were extinguished, and Buck
brought Slip from the kitchen inside to Rasba.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;This is Slip,&#8221; Buck explained, and the two shook
hands, the fugitive staring anxiously at the other&#8217;s face,
expecting recognition.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Don&#8217;t yo&#8217; know me, Parson?&#8221; Slip exclaimed.
&#8220;Jock Drones. Don&#8217;t yo&#8217; know me?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Jock Drones?&#8221; Rasba cried, staring. &#8220;Why, Sho!
Hit is! Lawse&mdash;an&#8217; I found yo&#8217; right yeah&mdash;thisaway!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yassuh,&#8221; Jock turned away under that bright
gaze, &#8220;but I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back, Parson! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back to
stand trial, suh! I neveh knowed any man, not a blood
relation would think so much of me, as to come way
down yeah to tell me my mammy, my good ole mammy,

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;An&#8217; good, Jock!&#8221; Rasba cried.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;An&#8217; good, suh,&#8221; the young man added, obediently.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;d better go over and see our sick man,&#8221; Buck
turned to Slip.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A sick man?&#8221; Rasba asked. &#8220;Where mout he be?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;In that other shanty-boat, that little boat,&#8221; Slip
exclaimed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all go!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When they entered the little boat, which sagged
under their combined weights, Slip held the light so it
would shine on the cot.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; Rasba exclaimed. &#8220;Hyar&#8217;s my friend who
got shot by a lady!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, suh, Parson!&#8221; Prebol grinned, feebly. &#8220;Seems

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon possessed a newspaper man&#8217;s feeling
of aloofness and detachment. When he went
afloat on the Mississippi at St. Louis he had no
intention of becoming a part of the river phenomena,
and it did not occur to his mind that his position might
become that of a participator rather than an observer.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The great river was interesting. It had come to his
attention several years before, when he read Parkman&#8217;s
&#8220;La Salle,&#8221; and a little later he had read almost a column
account of a flood down the Mississippi. The
A. P. had collected items from St. Louis, Cincinnati,
Memphis, Cairo, Natchez, Vicksburg, Baton Rouge,
and New Orleans, and fired them into the aloof East.
New York, Boston, Bangor, Utica, Albany, and other
important centres had learned for the first time that a
&#8220;levee&#8221;&mdash;whatever that might be&mdash;had suffered a
cravasse; a steamboat and some towbarges had been
wrecked, that Cairo was registering 63.3 on the gauge;
that some Negroes had been drowned; that cattle
thieves were operating in the Overflow, and so on and
so forth.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The combination of La Salle&#8217;s last adventure and
the Mississippi flood caught the fancy of the newspaper
man.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Shall I ever get out there?&#8221; Terabon asked himself.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His dream was not of reporting wars, not of exploring
Africa, not of interviewing kings and making presidents
in a national convention. Far from it! His mind
caught at the suggestion of singing birds in their native
trees, and he could without regret think of spending
days with a magnifying glass, considering the ant, or
worshipping at the stalk of the flowering lily.

several hundred dollars in the Chambers Street Savings
Bank. It happened that the city editor called him to

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You go to hell!&#8221; the reporter replied, smilingly,

and three days later he was in the office of the secretary
of the Mississippi River Commission, at St. Louis,
calmly inquiring into the duties and performance
thereof, involving the efforts of 100,000 Negroes,
40,000 mules, 500 contractors, 10,000 government
officials, a few hundred pieces of floating plant, and
sundry other things which Terabon had conceived were
of importance.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had approached the Mississippi River from the
human angle. He knew of no other way of approach.
His first view of the river, as he crossed the Merchants
Bridge, had not disturbed his equilibrium in the least,
and he had floated out of an eddy in a 16-foot skiff still
with the human-viewpoint approach.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then had begun a combat in his mind between all
his preconceived ideas and information and the river
realities. Faithfully, in the notebooks which he carried,
he put down the details of his mental disturbances.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>By the time he reached Island No. 10 sandbar he
had about resigned himself to the whimsicalities of
river living. He had, however, preserved his attitude
of aloofness and extraneousness. He regarded himself
as a visiting observer who would record the events in
which others had a part. It still pleased his fancy to
say that he was interviewing the Mississippi River
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
as he might interview the President of the United
States.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>But as Lester Terabon rowed his skiff back up the
eddy above New Madrid, and breasted the current in
the sweep of the reach to that little cabin-boat half a
mile above the Island No. 10 light, his attitude was
undergoing a conscious change. While he had been
reporting the Mississippi River in its varying moods
something had encircled him and grasped him, and was
holding him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For some time he had felt the change in his position;
glimmerings of its importance had appeared in his
notes; his mind had fought against it as a corruption,
lest it ruin the career which he had mapped out for
himself.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When the New Madrid fish-dock man told him to
carry the warning that a &#8220;detector&#8221; was hunting for a
certain woman, and that the detective had gone on
down with some river fellows, his place as a river man
was assured. River folks trusted and used him as
they used themselves. Moreover, he was possessed of
a vital river secret.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia Crele, <i>alias</i> Nelia Carline, was the woman,
and they were both stopping over at the Island No. 10
sandbar. He knew, what the fish-dock man probably
did not know, that the pursuer was the woman&#8217;s husband.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What&#8217;ll I tell her?&#8221; Terabon asked himself.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>With that question he uncovered an unsuspected
depth to his feelings. It was a dark, dull day. The
waves rolled and fell back, sometimes the wind seeming
the stronger and then the current asserting its
weight. With the wind&#8217;s help over the stern, Terabon
swiftly passed the caving bend and landed in the
lee above the young woman&#8217;s boat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He carried some things he had bought for her into
the kitchen and they sat in the cabin to read newspapers
and magazines which he had obtained.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I heard some news, too,&#8221; he told her.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes? What news?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;The fish-dock man at New Madrid told me to tell
the people along that a detective has gone on down,
looking for a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A detective looking for a woman?&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A man the name of Carline&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He flushed. Almost an hour had elapsed since he had
returned. He had found it difficult to mention the
subject.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I did not tell you either,&#8221; he apologized, &#8220;that I
happened to meet Mr. Carline up at Island No. 8, when
I had no idea the good fortune would come to me
of meeting you, whose&mdash;whose pictures he showed me.
I could not&mdash;I saw&#8211;&#8211;There was&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t tell me,&#8221; she accused him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It seemed to me none of my affair. I&#8217;m a newspaper
man&mdash;I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And did that excuse you from letting me know of
his&mdash;of that pursuit of me?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His newspaper impartiality had failed him, and he
hung his head in doubt and shame. She claimed, and
she deserved, his friendship; the last vestige of his pretence
of mere observation was torn from him. He
was a human among humans&mdash;and he had a fervid
if unexpected thought about the influence and exasperation
of the river out yonder.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I could not tell you!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think&mdash;it
seemed&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You know, then, you saw why I had left him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Liquor!&#8221; he grasped at the excuse. &#8220;Oh, that was
plain enough.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Perhaps a woman could forgive liquor,&#8221; she suggested,
thoughtfully, &#8220;but not&mdash;not stupidity and
indifference. He never disturbed the dust on any of
the books of his library. Oh, what they meant my
books mean to me!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She turned and stared at her book shelves.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Suppose you hadn&#8217;t found books?&#8221; he asked, glad
of the opportunity for a diversion.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;d be dead, I think,&#8221; she surmised, &#8220;and one day, I
did deliberately choose.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;How was that?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Get your notebook!&#8221; she jeered. &#8220;I thought if
he was going to rely on the specious joys of liquor I
would, and tried it. It was a blizzard day last winter.
He had gone over to see the widow, and there was a
bottle of rum in the cupboard. I took some hot milk,
nutmeg, sugar, and rum. I&#8217;ve never felt so happy in
my life, except&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;With what exception?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yesterday,&#8221; she answered, laughing, &#8220;and last
night and to-day! You see, I&#8217;m free now. I say and
do what I please. I don&#8217;t care any more. I&#8217;m perfectly
brazen. I don&#8217;t love you, but I like you very
much. You&#8217;re good company. I hope I am, too&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You are&mdash;splendid!&#8221; he cried, almost involuntarily,
and she shivered.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go walking again, will you?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
want to get out in the wind; I want to have the sky
overhead, a sandbar under my feet, and all outdoors at
my command. You don&#8217;t mind, you&#8217;d like to go?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;To the earth&#8217;s end!&#8221; he replied, recklessly, and her
gay laugh showed how well he had pleased her mood.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They kept close up to the north side of the bar because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
down the wind the sand was lifting and rolling
up in yellow clouds. They went to Winchester Chute,
and followed its winding course through the wood
patch. There was a slough of green water, with a
flock of ducks which left precipitately on their approach.
They returned down to the sandbar, and pressed their
way through the thick clump of small willows into the
switch willows and along the edge of the unbroken
desert of sand. They could see the very surface of the
bar rolling along before the wind, and as they walked
along they found their feet submerged in the blast.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>But when they arrived at the boat night was near at
hand, and the enveloping cold became more biting and
the gloom more depressing.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Just when they had eaten their supper together,
and had seated themselves before the fire, and when
the whirl and whistle of the wind was heard in the mad
music of a river storm, a motorboat with its cut-out
open ploughed up the river through the dead eddy and
stopped to hail.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Jim Talum, a fisherman whose line of hoop nets filled
the reach of Island No. 9 for eight or ten miles, was on
his way to his tent which he had pitched at the head of
Winchester Chute.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He tramped aboard, and welcomed a seat by the fire.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;&#8217;Lowed I&#8217;d drap in a minute,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Powerful

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, just tripping,&#8221; Terabon replied. &#8220;I was down
to New Madrid this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m just up from there. Ho law! Theh&#8217;s one man

Anyhow, he&#8217;s a strangeh on the riveh. He&#8217;s got a
nice power boat, an&#8217; likely he&#8217;s got money. If he has,
good-bye! Them Despards&#8217;d kill a man for $10.
One of &#8217;em, Hilt Despard&#8217;s onto the bo&#8217;t with him, pretendin&#8217;
to be a sport, an&#8217; they&#8217;ve drapped out. The rest

come daid.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The fisherman had been alone so much that the pent-up
conversation of weeks flowed uninterruptedly. He
told details; he described the motorboat; he laughed at
the astonishment the man would feel when the pirates
disclosed their intentions with a bullet or knife; and he
expected, by and by, to hear the story of the tragedy
through the medium of some whiskey boater, some river
gossip coming up in a power boat.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For an hour he babbled and then, as precipitately as
he had arrived, he took his departure. When he was
gone, Nelia Crele turned to Terabon with helpless dismay.
Augustus Carline was worthless; he had been
faithless to her; he had inflicted sufferings beyond her
power of punishment or forgiveness.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;But he&#8217;s looking for me!&#8221; she recapitulated, &#8220;and

rat! What can I do?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Obviously there was nothing that she could do, but
Lester Terabon rose instantly.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do that for me!&#8221; her voice lifted in a cry of

They can&#8217;t, for the gang&#8217;s in a shanty-boat.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She walked up to him with her arms raised.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;How can I thank you?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;You

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Pirates have infested the Mississippi from the
earliest days. The stranger on the river cannot
possibly know a pirate when he sees one, and
even shanty-boaters of long experience and sharp eyes
penetrate their disguises with difficulty. How could
Gus Carline suspect the loquacious, ingratiating, and
helpful Renald Doss?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Lonely; pursued by doubts, ignorance, and a lurking
timidity, Carline was only too glad to take on a companion

river commissioners by their first names, knew all the
makes of motors, and called the depth of the water in
Point Pleasant crossing by reading the New Madrid
gauge.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He relinquished the wheel of his boat to the dapper
little man, and fed the motor more gas, or slowed down

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I should say so; there was a fellow come down

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir! He got me to drinking heavy. I like

through me, but he didn&#8217;t get all I had, you bet!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>This was rich!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Lucky he didn&#8217;t hit you on the head, and take the
boat, too!&#8221; Doss grinned.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir! Lots of mean men on this river, they play

any old game. They say they&#8217;re preachers, or umbrella
menders, or anything. Every once in a while some
feller comes down, saying he&#8217;s off&#8217;n some magazine.
They come down in skiffs, mostly. It&#8217;s a great game
they play. Everybody tells &#8217;em everything. If I
was going to be a crook, I bet I&#8217;d say I was a hist&#8217;ry
writer. I&#8217;d snoop around, and then I&#8217;d land&mdash;same&#8217;s

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The little man laughed in his throat. He handled
the boat like a river pilot. His eyes turned to the
banks, swept the sandbars, gazed into the coiling waters
alongside, and he whispered names of places as he
passed them&mdash;landings, bars, crossings, bends, and
even the plantations and log cuttings. He named the
three cotton gins in Tiptonville, and stared at the ferry
below town with a sidelong leer.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;She&#8217;d just soon shoot a man as look at him,&#8221; Doss
added, with a touch of asperity.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why&mdash;she&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; Carline hesitated. He recalled
a day in his own experience when she took his own shot
gun from him, and stood a fury, flaming with anger.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir, she would,&#8221; Doss declared, with finality.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Doss had seen her. By that time a thousand shanty-boaters
had heard about that girl&#8217;s one shot of deadly
accuracy. The woman folks on a thousand miles of
reach and bend had had a bad example set before
them. Doss himself felt an anger which was impotent
against the woman who had shot Jest Prebold down.
Probably other women would take to shooting, right
off the bat, the same way. He despised that idea.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Carline, doubtful as to whether his wife was being
insulted, congratulated, or described, gazed at the photograph.
The more he looked, the more exasperated
he felt. She was a woman&mdash;what right had she to run
away and leave him with his honour impugned? He
felt as though he hadn&#8217;t taught her her place. At the
same time, when he looked at the picture, he discovered
a remembrance of his feeling that she was a very difficult
person to teach anything to. Her learning always
had insulted his own meagreness of information and
aptness in repartee. Next to not finding her, his big
worry had become finding her.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They steered down the river without great haste.
Doss studied the shanty-boats which he saw moored
in the various eddies, large and small. Some he spoke
of casually, as store-boats, fishermen, market hunters,
or, as they passed between Caruthersville and the opposite
shore, a gambling boat. Even the river pirate,
gloating over his prey, and puzzled only as to the
method of making the most of his victim, could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
penetrate the veil which it happened the Mississippi
River interposed between them and the river gambling
den&mdash;for the moment. There is no use seeking the
method of the river, nor endeavouring to discover the
processes by which the lives of thousands who go afloat
down the Mississippi are woven as woof and warp
in the fabric of river life and river mysteries. The
more faithful an effort to select one of the commonest
and simplest of river complications, the more improbable
and fanciful it must seem.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Doss, in intervals when he was not consciously registering
the smile of good humour, the generosity of an
experienced man toward the chance visitor, and the
willingness to defer to the gentleman from Up the Bank,
brought his expression unconsciously to the cold, rough
woodenness of blank insensitiveness&mdash;the malignance
of a snapping turtle, to mention a medium reptilian
face. A whim, and the necessity of delay, led Doss
to suggest that they take a look up the Obion River
as a likely hiding place. Of course, Doss knew best,
and they quit the tumbling Mississippi for the quiet
wooded aisle of the little river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When they emerged, two days later, Augustus Carline
could well thank his stars, though he did not know
it, that he was still on the boat. All unconscious of the
real nature and habits of river rats he had given the
little wretch a thousand opportunities to commit one
of the many crimes he had in mind. But he developed
a reluctance to choose the easiest one, when from hint
after hint he understood that a mere river piracy and
murder would be folly in view of the opportunity for a
more profitable stake which a man of means offered.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As he steered by the government boat which was
surveying Plum Point bars, Doss showed his teeth
like an indignant cat. Five or six miles below he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
offered the supine and helpless Carline the information:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;There&#8217;s Yankee Bar. We&#8217;ll swing wide and land
in below, so&#8217;s not to scare up any geese or ducks that
may be roosting there.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Eagerly Doss searched through the switch willows for
a glimpse of the setback of the water beyond the bar.
Away down in the old eddy he discovered a shanty-boat,
and to cover his involuntary exclamation of satisfaction
he said:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Shucks! There&#8217;s somebody theh. I hoped we&#8217;d
have it to ourselves but they may be sports, too. If
they are, we&#8217;ll sure have a good time. Some of these
shanty-boaters are great sports. We&#8217;ll soon find out!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He steered into the eddy and the two men stepped
out on the flat boat&#8217;s deck to greet them.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Seems like I&#8217;ve seen them before,&#8221; Doss said in a
low voice; &#8220;I believe they&#8217;re old timers. Hello, boys!
Hunting?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, suh! Lots of game. Sho, ain&#8217; yo&#8217; Doss, Ren
Doss?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You bet. I knew you! I told Mr. Carline, here,
that I knew you, that I&#8217;d seen you before! I&#8217;m glad
to see you boys again. Catch a line there.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No doubt about it, they were old friends. In a minute
they were shaking hands all around, then went
into the shanty-boat, and they sat down in assorted
chairs, and Doss, Jet, and Cope exchanged the gossip of
a river year.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Carline&#8217;s eyes searched about him with interest,
and the three men watched him more and more openly.
When he walked toward the bow of the boat, where the
slope of the yellow sand led up to the woods of Flower
Island, one of them casually left his seat and followed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Carline looked at the stand of guns in the cabin corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
and started with surprise. He reached and picked
up one of them to look at it.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;this is my shot gu&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No more. His light went out on the instant and he
felt that he was suspended in mid-air, poised between
the abyss and the heavens.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Fortune, or rather the Father of Waters, had
favoured Parson Elijah Rasba in the accomplishment
of his errand. It might not have
happened in a decade that he locate a fugitive within
a hundred miles of Cairo, where the Forks of the Ohio
is the jumping-off place of the stream of people from a
million square miles.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba knew it. The fervour of the prophets was in
his heart, and the light of understanding was brightening
in his mind. Something seemed to have caught
the doors of his intelligence and thrown them wide
open.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In the pent-up valleys of the mountains, with their
little streams, their little trails, their dull and hopeless
inhabitants, their wars begun in disputes over pigs and
abandoned peach orchards, their moonshine and hate of
government revenues, there had been no chance for
Parson Rasba to get things together in his mind.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The days and nights on the rivers had opened his
eyes. When he asked himself: &#8220;If this is the Mississippi,
what must the Jordan be?&#8221; he found a perspective.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Sitting there beside the wounded Jest Prebol, by
the light of a big table lamp, he &#8220;wrestled&#8221; with his
Bible the obscurities of which had long tormented his
ignorance and baffled his mental bondage.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The noises of the witches&#8217; hours were in the air.
Wavelets splashed along the side and under the bow
of the Prebol shanty-boat. The mooring ropes stretched
audibly, and the timber heads to which they were
fastened squeaked and strained; the wind slapped and
hissed and whined on all sides, crackling through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
heavy timber up the bank. The great river pouring
by seemed to have a low, deep growl while the wind in
the skies rumbled among the clouds.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No wonder Rasba could understand! He could
imagine anything if he did not hold fast to that great
Book which rested on his knees, but holding fast to it,
the whisperings and chucklings and hissings which filled
the river wilderness, and the deep tone of the flood,
the hollow roar of the passing storm, were but signs of
the necessity of faith in the presence of the mysteries.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So Rasba wrestled; so he grappled with the things
he must know, in the light of the things he did know.
And a kind of understanding which was also peace
comforted him. He closed the Book at last, and let
his mind drift whither it would.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Panoramas of the river, like pictures, unfolded before
his eyes; he remembered flashes taken of men, women,
and children; he dwelt for a time on the ruin of the
church up there in the valley, standing vainly against a
mountain slide; his face warmed, his eyes moistened.
His mind seized eagerly upon a vision of the memory,
the pretty woman, whose pistol had shot down the deluded
and now stricken wretch there in the cabin.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The anomaly of the fact that he was caring for her
victim was not lost on his shrewd understanding. He
was gathering up and helping patch the wreckage she
was making. It was a curious conceit, and Elijah
Rasba, while he smiled at the humour of it, was at the
same time conscious of its sad truth.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Her presence on the river meant no good for any one;
Prebol was but one of her victims; perhaps he was the
least unfortunate of them all! Others might perish
through her, while it was not too much to hope that
Prebol, through his sufferings, might be willing to profit
by their lesson. Rasba was glad that he had not overtaken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
her that night of inexplicable pursuit. Her
brightness, her prettiness, her appeal had been irresistible
to him, and he could but acknowledge, while he
trembled at the fact, that for the time he had been
possessed by her enchantment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Thus he meditated and puzzled about the things
which, in his words, had come to pass. Before he knew
it, daylight had arrived, and Jock Drones came over to
greet him with &#8220;Good mo&#8217;nin&#8217;, Parson!&#8221; Prebol was
sleeping and there was colour in his cheeks, enough to
make them look more natural. When Doctor Grell
arrived, just as the three sat down to breakfast, he
cheered them with the information that Prebol was
coming through though the shadow had rested close to
him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>None of them admitted, even to himself, the strain
the wounded man had been and was on their nerves.
Under his seeming indifference Buck was near the
breaking point; Jock, victim of a thousand worries,
was bent under his burdens. Grell, having fought the
all-night fight for a human life, was still weak with
weariness from the effort. Rasba, a newcomer, brought
welcome reserves of endurance, assistance, and confidence.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yo&#8217; men shore have done yo&#8217; duty by a man in
need,&#8221; he told them, and none of them could understand
why that truthful statement should make them
feel so very comfortable.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They left the sick man to go on board the gaming
boat, and they sat on the stern deck, where they
looked across the river and the levee to the roofs of
Caruthersville. If they looked at the horizon, their
attention was attracted and their gaze held by the
swirling of the river current. Their eyes could not be
drawn away from that tremendous motion, the rush of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
a thousand acres of surface; the senses were appalled by
the magnitude of its suggestion.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Going to play to-night?&#8221; Grell asked, uneasily.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No,&#8221; Buck replied, instantly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;So!&#8221; the doctor exclaimed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Slip&#8217;s going up on the steamboat.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;For good?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;So&#8217;m I!&#8221; Buck continued, breathlessly; &#8220;I&#8217;m quitting
the riveh, too! I&#8217;ve been down here a good many
years. I&#8217;ve been thinking. I&#8217;m going back. I&#8217;m
going up the bank again.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you do with the boat?&#8221; Grell continued.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Slip and I&#8217;ve been talking it all over. We&#8217;re
through with it. We guessed the Prophet, here, could
use it. We&#8217;re going to give it to him.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Going to give hit to me!&#8221; Rasba started up and
stared at the man.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, Parson; that poplar boat of yours isn&#8217;t what
you need down here.&#8221; Buck smiled. &#8220;This big pine
boat&#8217;s better; you could preach in this boat.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Tears started in Rasba&#8217;s eyes and dripped through
his dark whiskers. Buck and Jock had acted with the
impulsiveness of gambling men. Something in the
fact that Rasba had come down those strange miles
had touched them, had given Drones courage to go
back and face the music, and to Buck the desire to return
into his old life.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;We&#8217;re going up on the <i>Kate</i> to-morrow morning,&#8221;
Buck explained. &#8220;Slip&#8217;d better show you how to run the
gasolene boat if you don&#8217;t know how, Parson!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Dazed by the access of fortune, Rasba spent the mid-afternoon
learning to run the 28-foot gasolene launch
which was used to tow the big houseboat which would
make such a wonderful floating church. It was a big
boat only a little more than two years old. Buck had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
made it himself, on the Upper Mississippi, for a gambling
boat. The frame was light, and the cabin was built
with double boards, with building paper between, to
keep out the cold wintry winds.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; Rasba choked, looking at the two
donors of the gift, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be the best kind of a
man I know how&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s your job to be a parson,&#8221; Buck laughed. &#8220;If
it wasn&#8217;t for men like us, that need reforming, you&#8217;d
be up against it for something to look out for. You
aren&#8217;t much used to the river, and I&#8217;ll suggest that when
you drop down you land in eddies sheltered from the
west and south winds. They sure do tear things up
sometimes. I&#8217;ve had the roof tore off a boat I was in,
and I saw sixty-three boats sunk at Cairo&#8217;s Kentucky
shanty-boat town one morning after a big wind.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep a-lookin&#8217;,&#8221; Rasba assured him, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve
kind-a lost the which-way down heah. One day I had
the sun ahead, behind, and both sides&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;There&#8217;s maps in that pile of stuff in the corner,&#8221;
Buck said, going to the duffle. &#8220;You&#8217;re on Sheet 4
now. Here&#8217;s Caruthersville.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh. Those red lines?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;The new survey. You see, that sandbar up in
Little Prairie Bend has cut loose from Island No. 15,
and moved down three miles, and we&#8217;re at the foot of
this bar, here. That&#8217;s moved down, too, and that
big bar down there was made between the surveys. You
see, they had to move the levee back, and Caruthersville
moved over the new levee&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; Rasba gasped. &#8220;What ails this old riveh?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;She jes&#8217; wriggles, same&#8217;s water into a muddy road
downhill,&#8221; Kippy laughed. &#8220;Up there in Little
Prairie Bend hit&#8217;s caved right through the old levee, and
they had to loop around. Now they&#8217;ve reveted it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Reveted?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They&#8217;ve woven a willow mattress and weighted it
down with broken rock from up the river&mdash;more than
a mile of it, now, and they&#8217;ll have to put down another
mile before they can head the river off there.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Put a carpet down. How wide?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Four hundred feet probably&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;An&#8217; a mile long!&#8221; Rasba whispered, awed. &#8220;Every
thing&#8217;s big on the riveh!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;that&#8217;s it&mdash;big!&#8221; Buck laughed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Thus the four gossiped, and when Doctor Grell had
taken his departure the three talked together about
the river and its wonders. At intervals they went
over to look after Prebol whose chief requirement was
quiet, meat broths, and his medicines.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As night drew down Drones turned to Buck:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be hard leaving the riveh! I neveh will
forget, Buck. If I&#8217;m sent to jail for all my life, I&#8217;ll
have something to remember. If they hang me, I
shore will come back to walk with those that walk in
the middle of the river.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Rasba turned and demanded.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Riveh folks believe that thousands of people who
died down thisaway, sunk in snagged steamers, caught
in burned-up boats, blown to kingdom come in boiler
explosions, those that have been murdered, and who
died along the banks, keep a-goin&#8217; up and down.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; Rasba exclaimed. &#8220;Yo&#8217; b&#8217;lieve that?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A man believes a heap more after he&#8217;s tripped the
riveh once or twice, than he ever believed in all his
borned days, eh, Buck?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;It&#8217;s so!&#8221; Buck cried out. &#8220;Last night I was thinking
that I&#8217;d wasted my life down here; years and years
I&#8217;ve been a shanty-boater, drifter, fisherman, trapper,
market hunter, and late years, I&#8217;ve gambled. I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
been getting in bad, worse all the while. The Prophet
here, coming along, seemed to wake me up&mdash;the man I
used to be&mdash;I mean. It wasn&#8217;t so much what you said,
Parson, but your being here. Then I&#8217;ve been thinking
all over again. I&#8217;ve an idea, boys, that when I go
back up to-morrow I won&#8217;t be so sorry for what I&#8217;ve
been, as glad that I didn&#8217;t grow worse than I did. It
won&#8217;t be easy, boys&mdash;going back. I&#8217;m taking the old
river with me, though. I&#8217;ve framed its bends and islands,
its chutes and reaches, like pictures in my mind.
Old Parson here, too, coming in on us the way he did,
saying that this was hell, but he&#8217;d come here to live
in it. That&#8217;s what waked me up, Parson! I could see
how you felt. You&#8217;d never seen such a place before,
but you said in your heart and your eyes showed it,
Parson, that you would leave God&#8217;s country to help
us poor devils. It&#8217;s just a point of view, though. I&#8217;m
going right up to my particular hell, and I&#8217;ll look back
here to this thousand miles of river as heaven. Yes,
sir! But my job is up there&mdash;in that hell!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So they talked, and always their thoughts were on
the river channel, and their minds groping into the future.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When the <i>Kate</i> whistled way down at Bell&#8217;s Landing,
Rasba took the two across to Caruthersville and bade
them good-bye at the landing.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The <i>Kate</i> pulled out and Parson Rasba crossed to
the three houseboats, two of them his own. He
went in to see Prebol, who was lonesome and wanted to
talk a little.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What you going to do, Parson?&#8221; Prebol asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;d kind-a like to get to see shanty-boaters, and talk
to them,&#8221; the man answered. &#8220;I wonder couldn&#8217;t yo&#8217;
sort of he&#8217;p me; tell me where I mout begin and where
it&#8217;d he&#8217;p the most, an&#8217; hurt people&#8217;s feelin&#8217;s the least?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
I&#8217;d jes&#8217; kind-a like to be useful. Course, I got to get
you cured up an&#8217; took cyar of first.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I cayn&#8217;t say much about being pious on Old Mississip&#8217;,&#8221;
Prebol grinned, &#8220;but theh&#8217;s two ways of findin&#8217;
trouble. One&#8217;s to set still long enough, and then,
again, you can go lookin&#8217; fo&#8217; hit. Course, yo&#8217; know me!
I&#8217;ve hunted trouble pretty fresh, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve found hit,
an&#8217; I&#8217;ve lived onto hit. I cayn&#8217;t he&#8217;p much about doin&#8217;
good, an&#8217; missionaryin&#8217;, an&#8217; River Prophetin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When Prebol&#8217;s voice showed the strain of talking
Rasba bade him rest. Then he went over to the big
boat, a gift that would have sold for $1,000. He looked
at the crap table, the little poker tables with the brass-slot
kitties; he stared at the cabinet of cards and dice.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;All mine!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He walked out on the deck where he could commune
with the river, using his eyes, his ears, and the feeling
that the warm afternoon gave him. The sun shone
upon him, and made a narrow pathway across the
rushing torrent. The sky was blue and cloudless.
Of the cold, the wind, the sea of liquid mud, not one
trace remained.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He looked down and up the river, and his eyes caught
a flicker which became a flutter, like the agitation of a
duck preening its feathers on a smooth surface.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He watched it for a long time. He did not know
what it was. As a river man, his curiosity was excited,
but there was something more than mere curiosity;
the river instinct that the inexplicable and unknown
should be watched and inquired into moved him almost
unconsciously to watch that distant agitation which
became a dot afloat in a mirage of light. A little later a
sudden flash along the river surface disclosed that the
thing was a shanty-boat turning in the coiling currents
at the bend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The sun drew nearer the tree tops. The little cabin-boat
was seeking a place to land or anchor for the night.
If it was an old river man, the boat would drop into
some little eddy at Caruthersville or down below; but a
stranger on the river would likely shoot across into the
gamblers&#8217; eddy tempted, perhaps, by the three boats
already there.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The boat drew swiftly near, and as it ran down, the
navigator rowed to make the shanty-boat eddy. Parson
Rasba discovered that it was a woman at the
sweeps, and a few strokes later he knew that it was
a slim, young woman. When she coasted down outside
the eddy, to swing in at the foot, and arrived opposite
him, he recognized her.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;God he&#8217;p me!&#8221; he choked, &#8220;hit&#8217;s Missy Nelia.
Hit&#8217;s Missy Nelia! An&#8217; she&#8217;s a runned away married
woman&mdash;an&#8217; theh&#8217;s the man she shot!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hello-o, Parson!&#8221; she hailed him, &#8220;did you see a
skiff with a reporter man drop by?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, missy!&#8221; he shook his head, his heart giving a
painful thump</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-landing in, Parson!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I want to
talk with you!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>With that she leaned forward, drove the sweeps
deep, and her boat started in like a skiff. It seemed to
Parson Rasba that he had never seen a more beautiful
picture in all his days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Lester Terabon rowed down the rolling river
waters in the dark night. He had, of course,
looked out into the Mississippi shades from the
security of landing, anchorage, and sandbar; he knew
the looks of the night but not the activities of currents
and bends when a gale is sweeping by and the air is, by
turns, penetrated by the hissing of darting whitecaps
and the roar of the blustering winds.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He would not from choice have selected a night of
gale for a pull down the Mississippi, and his first sensation
as he sought a storm wave stroke was one of doubt.
What dangers might engulf him was not plain, not the
waves, for his skiff bobbed and rocked over them; not
river pirates bent on plunder, for they could not see
him; perhaps a snag in the shallows of a crossing; perhaps
the leap of a sawyer, a great tree trunk with
branches fast in the mud and the roots bounding up
and down in the current; perhaps a collision with some
other craft.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had salt-water rowlocks on his boat, open-topped
&#8220;U&#8221; sockets, and the oars he used were cased with a
foot of black leather and collars of leather strips; the
tips were covered with copper sheets which gave
them weight and balance. At first he pulled awkwardly,
catching crabs in the hollows and backing into
the heft of the waves, but after a time he felt the
waves as they came, and the oars feathered and caught.
While he watched ahead and searched the black horizon
for the distant sparkle of government lights, he fell into
the swing of his stroke before he knew it, and he was
interested and surprised to observe that he swayed to the
side-wash while he pulled to the rhythm of the waves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The government lights guided him. He had not paid
much attention to them before; he had seen their white
post standards as he dropped down, day after day, but
his skiff, drawing only five inches of water, passed over
the shallowest crossings and along the most gradually
sloping sandbars. Now he must keep to the deep
water, follow the majestic curves and sweeps of the
meandering channel, lest he collide with a boiling
eddy, ram the shore line of sunken trees, or climb the
point of a towhead.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was all a new experience, and its novelty compelled
him at times to pause in his efforts to jot down a few
hasty words by light of a little electric flash to preserve
in his memory the sequence of the constantly varying
features of the night, beginning with the curtain of the
shanty-boat which flicked its good luck after him,
passing the bright, clear lights of New Madrid. After
leaving far behind their glow against the thin haze in
the night he &#8220;made&#8221; the scattered shoals of Point
Pleasant, and hugged down vanishing Ruddles Point,
taking a glimpse of Tiptonville&mdash;which withdraws
year by year from the fatal caving brink of its site&mdash;wishing
as he passed that he might return to that
strange place and visit Reelfoot Lake three or four miles
beyond, where the New Madrid earthquakes drowned a
forest whose dead stubs rise as monuments to the
tragedy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In Little Cypress Bend, twenty-five miles below
where he had left the young woman, he heard the
splash and thud of a caving bank, and felt the big
rollers from the falling earth twisting and tumbling
him about for a third of a mile.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was after 1 o&#8217;clock when he looked at his watch.
He was beginning to feel the pull on his shoulders, and
the crick which constantly looking over his shoulder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
to see the lights ahead caused him. The dulness of
his vision, due to inevitable fatigue, compelled him constantly
to sit more alert and dash away the fine spray
which whipped up from the waves. A feeling of listlessness
overpowered him. He could not row on
forever, without resting at all. Taking advantage of a
moment of calm in the wind, he pulled the bow around
and drifted down stern first.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had lost track of his position; he had not counted
the lights, and now for many miles there was no town
distinguishable. He had felt the loneliness of a mile-breadth;
now he wondered whether he was in Missouri
or Arkansas, whether he had come forty miles or
eighty, and after a little he began to worry for fear he
might have gone more than a hundred.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>With the wind astern or nearly astern, he knew that
he had pulled four or five miles an hour, and he did
not know how fast the current of the river ran; it might
be four miles or eight miles. In ten hours he might
leave more than a hundred miles of river bank behind
him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A new sensation began to possess him: the feeling
that he was not alone. He looked around, while he
rested trying to find what proximity thus affected him.
The wind? Those dull banks, seemingly so distant?
Perhaps some fellow traveller? It was none of those
things.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was the river! The &#8220;feel&#8221; of the flood was that
of a person. He could not shake off the sensation,
which seemed absurd. He shook his head resolutely
and then searched through the gloom to discover
what eyes might be shining in it. He saw the inevitable
government lights between which was deep water
and a safe channel. He had but to keep on the line
between the lights, cutting across when he spied another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
one far ahead. The lights but accentuated the certainty
that on all sides, but a little way from him, a
host of invisible beings speculated on his presence and
influenced his course.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A newspaper man of much experience could not help
but protest in his practical mind against such a determination
of the invisible and the unknown to give him
such nonsensical ideas. He had in play, in intellectual
persiflage, and with some show of traditional reasonableness,
called Nelia Crele &#8220;a river goddess.&#8221; She was
very well placed in his mind&mdash;a reckless woman, pretty,
with a fine character for a masterpiece of fiction (should
he ever get to the story-writing stage) and a delight to
think about; commanding, too, mysterious and exacting;
and now he thought it might be the laughter of her
voice that carried in the wind, not a mocking laugh,
nor a jeering one, but one of sweet encouragement which
neither distance nor circumstances could dismiss from
a distressed and reluctant heart, let alone a heart so
willing to receive as his.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Lester Terabon accepted the possibility of river lore
and proclaimed beliefs. Fishermen, store-boaters, trippers,
pirates, and all sorts of the shanty-boaters whom
he had interviewed on his way down had solemnly
assured him that there were spirits who promenaded
down mid-stream, and who sometimes could be seen.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon was sorry when his cool, calculating mind
refused to believe his eyes, which saw shapes; his flesh,
which felt creeps; his ears, which heard voices; and his
nostrils, which caught a whiff of a faint, sweet perfume
more exquisite than any which he remembered.
He knew that when he had kissed the river goddess
whose eyes were blue, whose flesh was fair, whose grace
was lovely, he had tasted that nectar and sniffed that
ambrosia. He wondered if she were near him, watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
to see whether he performed well the task which
she had set for him, the rescue of the husband who had
forfeited her love, and yet who still was under her protection
since in his indignant sorrow he had supposed
himself capable of finding and retaining her.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon would have liked nothing better than to believe
what the Grecians used to believe, that goddesses
and gods do come down to the earth to mingle among
mankind. He fought the impossibility with his reason,
and night winds laughed at him, while the voices
of the waves chuckled at his predicament. They assailed
him with their presence like living things, and
then roared away to give room to new voices and new
presences.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; Terabon laughed, in spite of himself,
&#8220;you&#8217;re good company, Old Mississip&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Yet he felt the chilling and depressing possibility
that he might never again see that woman who would
remain as a &#8220;river goddess&#8221; in his imagination. He
had been heart-free, a bystander in the world&#8217;s affairs.
Now he knew what it was to see the memory of a woman
rise unbidden to disturb his calculations; more
than that, too, he was a part of the affairs of the River
People.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As a reporter &#8220;back home&#8221; he had never been able
quite to reconcile himself to his constant position as a
spectator, a neutral observer, obliged to write news
without feeling and impartially. A politician could
look him in the eye and tell him any smooth lie, and
he could not, with white heat, deny the statement.
He could not rise with his own strength to champion
the cause of what he knew to be right against wrong;
he could not elaborate on the details of things that he
felt most interested in, but must consult the fancies of a
not-particularly discriminating public, whose average
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
intelligence, according to some learned students, must
be placed at seventeen-years plus. As he was twenty-four
plus, Terabon was immensely discouraged with the
public when he had set forth down the Mississippi.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Now he was on the way from a river goddess to interfere
with the infamous plans of river pirates, through
a dry gale out of the north, on the winding course of the
Mississippi, a transition which troubled the self-possession
while it awakened the spirit of the young man.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Dawn broke on the troubled river, and the prospect
was enchanting to the heroic in the mind of the skiff-tripper.
He could not be sure which was east or west,
for the gray light appeared on all sides, in spots and
patches of varying size. No gleam reflected from the
yellow clay of the tumbling and tortured waters. As
far as he could see there was light, but not a bright
light. Dull purples, muddy waters, gray tree trunks,
black limbs against dark clouds; Terabon felt the weariness
of a desert, the melancholy of a wet, dripping-tree
wilderness, and of a tumbling waste of waters; and yet
never had the solid body of the stream been so awe-inspiring
as in that hour of creeping and insinuating
dawn.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He ran out into the main river again, and a wonderful
prospect opened before his eyes. Sandbars spread
out for miles across the river and lengthwise of the
river; the bulk of the stream seemed broken up into
channels and chutes and wandering waterways. He
saw column after column of lines of spiles, like black
teeth, through which the water broke with protesting
foam.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When he thought to reckon up, as he passed Osceola
Bar, he found that he had come ninety-five miles.
Yankee Bar was only five or six miles below him, and
he eagerly pulled down to inspect the long beaches, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
chutes and channels, which the river pirates had used
for not less than 150 years; where they still had their
rendezvous.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Wild ducks and geese were there in many flocks.
There were waters sheltered from the wind by willow
patches. The woods of Plum Point Peninsula were
heavy and dark. The river main current slashed
down the miles upon miles of Craighead Point, and
shot across to impinge upon Chickasaw Bluffs No. 1,
where a made dirt bank was silhouetted against the sky.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Not until his binoculars rested upon the bar at the
foot of Fort Pillow Bluff did Terabon&#8217;s eyes discover
any human beings, and then he saw a white houseboat
with a red hull. He headed toward it to ask the familiar
river question.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, suh!&#8221; the lank, sharp-eyed fisherman shook
his head. &#8220;Theh&#8217;s no motorboat landed up theh, not
this week. Who all mout you be?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Lester Terabon; I&#8217;m a newspaper writer; I live in
New York; I came down the Mississippi looking for
things to tell about in the newspapers. You see, lots
of people hardly know there&#8217;s a Mississippi River, and
it&#8217;s the most interesting place I ever heard of.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Terabon? I expect you all&#8217;s the feller Whiskey
Williams was tellin&#8217; about; yo&#8217;n a feller name of Carline
was up by No. 8. He said yo&#8217; had one of them
writin&#8217; machines right into a skift. Sho! An&#8217; yo&#8217;
have! The woman an&#8217; me&#8217;d jes&#8217; love to see yo&#8217; all
use hit.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see me,&#8221; Terabon laughed, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll let me
sit by your stove. I&#8217;ve some writing I could do. Here&#8217;s
a goose for dinner, too.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho! The woman shore will love to cook that
goose! I&#8217;m a fisherman but no hunter. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t
of&#8217;en we git a roast bird!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So Terabon sat by the stove, writing. He wrote
for more than an hour&mdash;everything he could remember,
with the aid of his pencilled midnight notes, about that
long run down. With his maps before him he recognized
the bends and reaches, the sandbars and islands
which had loomed up in the dark. Of all the parts of
the river, the hundred miles from Island No. 10 down
to Fort Pillow became the most familiar to his thoughts,
black though the night had been. Even each government
light began to have characteristics, and the sky-line
of levee, wilderness, sandbar, and caving bank grew
more and more defined.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Having written his notes, and Jeff Slamey having
fingered the nine loose-leaf sheets with exclamatory
interest and delight, Terabon said he must go rest
awhile.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh,&#8221; the fisherman cried, &#8220;when a man&#8217;s
pulled a hundred mile he shore needs sleep. When
the woman&#8217;s got that goose cooked, I bet yo&#8217;ll be ready
to eat, too.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So Terabon turned in to sleep. He was awakened
at last by the sizzling of a goose getting its final
basting. He started up, and Slamey said:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s ready. I bet yo&#8217; feel betteh, now; six hours
asleep!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It didn&#8217;t seem like six minutes of dreamless recreation.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>With night the wind fell. The flood of sunset brilliance
spread down the radiant sandbars and the
bright waterways. The trees were plated with silver
and gold, and the sweep of the caving bend was a dark
shadow against which the river current swept with
ceaseless attack.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For hours that night Terabon amused his host
with his adventures, except that he made but most casual
mention of the woman whom Carline was seeking.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
He was cautious, too, about the motorboat and
the companion who had taken Carline down the river,
till Slamey burst out:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I know that feller. He&#8217;s a bad man; he&#8217;s a river
rat. If he don&#8217;t kill Gus Carline, I don&#8217;t know these
yeah riveh fellers. They use down thisaway every
winter. I know; I know them all. I leave them alone,
an&#8217; they leave me alone. I knew they was comin&#8217;.
They got three four boats now. One feller, name of
Prebol&mdash;he&#8217;s bad, too&mdash;was shot by a lady above
Cairo. He&#8217;s with a coupla gamblers to Caruthersville
now. Everybody stops yeah; I know everybody;
everybody knows me.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The next day was calm all day long, and Terabon
went up the bank to shoot squirrels or other woods
game; he went almost up to the Plum Point, killed
several head of game, and rejoiced in the bayous and
sloughs and chutes of a changing land.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The following morning he was hailed by Slamey:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hi&mdash;i, Terabon! Theh&#8217;s a shanty-boat up the
head of Flower Island Bar jes&#8217; drappin&#8217; in. They&#8217;ve
floated down all night!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Through his glasses Terabon saw two men walking
a shanty-boat across the dead water below Yankee
Lower Bar to the mainland.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They were too far away for him to distinguish their
personalities, but one was a tall, active man, the other
obviously chunky, and when they ran their lines out
and made fast to half-buried snags, it was with the quick
decision of men used to work against currents and to
unison of effort. There was something suggestive in
their bearing, their scrutiny up and down the river,
their standing close to each other as they talked.
If Terabon had not suspected them of being pirates,
their attitude and actions would have betrayed them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon, after a little while, pulled up the eddy
toward them; he was willing to take a long chance.
Few men resent a newspaper man&#8217;s presence. The
worst of them like to put themselves, their ideas,
right with the world. Terabon risked their knavery to
win their approbation. Come what might, he would
seek to save Augustus Carline from the consequences
of his ignorance, money, folly, and remorse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The flow of the Mississippi River is down stream&mdash;a
perfectly absurd and trite statement at
first thought. On second thought, one reverts
to the people who are always trying to fight their way
up that adverse current, with the thrust of two miles
perpendicular descent and the body of a thousand
storms in its rush.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There are steamers which endeavour to stem the
current, but they make scant headway; sometimes a
fugitive afraid of the rails will pull up stream; the
birds do fly with the spring winds against the retreat
of winter; but all these things are trifles, and merely
accentuate the fact that everything goes down.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The sandbars are not fixed, they are literally rivers
of sand flowing down, tormenting the current, and keeping
human beings speculating on their probable course
and the effect, when after a few years on a point, they
disappear under the water. Later they will lunge up
and out into the wind again, gallumphing along, some
coarse gravel bars, some yellow sand, some white sand,
some fine quicksand, some gritty mud, and others of
mud almost fit to use in polishing silver.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Thousands of people in shanty-boats, skiff&#8217;s, fancy
little yachts, and jon-boats, rag-shacks on rafts, and serviceable
cruisers drift down with the flood, and are a
part of it.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Autumn was passing; most of the birds had speeded
south when the wild geese brought the alarm that a cold
norther was coming. When the storm had gone by,
shanty-boaters, having shivered with the cold, determined
not to be caught again. The sunshine of the
evening, when the wind died, saw boats drifting out for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
the all-night run. Dawn, calm and serene, found
boats moving out into mid-channel more or less in
haste.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So they floated down, sometimes within a few hundred
feet of other boats, sometimes in merry fleets tied
together by ropes and common joyousness, sometimes
alone in the midst of the vacant waters. The migration
of the shanty-boaters was watched with mingled hate,
envy, and admiration by Up-the-Bank folks, who pretend
to despise those who live as they please.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>And Nelia Carline pulled out into the current and
followed her river friend, Lester Terabon, who had gone
on ahead to save her husband from the river pirates.
She despised her husband more as she let her mind
dwell on the man who had shown no common frailties
while he did enjoy a comradeship which included the
charm of a pretty woman, recognizing her equality,
and not permitting her to forget for a moment that he
knew she was lovely, as well as intelligent.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She had not noticed that fact so much at the time, as
afterward, when she subjected him to the merciless
scrutiny of a woman who has heretofore discovered in
men only depravity, ignorance, selfishness, or brutality.
Her first thought had been to use Terabon, play with
him, and, if she could, hurt him. She knew that there
were men who go about plaguing women, and as she
subjected herself to grim analysis, she realized that in
her disappointment and humiliation she would have
hurt, while she hated, men.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The long hours down the river, in pleasant sunshine,
with only an occasional stroke of the oar to set the boat
around broadside to the current, enabled her to sit
on the bow of her boat and have it out with herself.
She had never had time to think. Things crowded her
Up-the-Bank. Now she had all the time in the world,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
and she used that time. She brought out her familiar
books and compared the masters with her own mind.
She could do it&mdash;there.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Ruskin, Carlyle, Old Mississip&#8217;, Plato, Plutarch,
Thoreau, the Bible, Shelley, Byron, and I, all together,
dropping down,&#8221; she chuckled, catching her breath.
&#8220;I&#8217;m tripping down in that company. And there&#8217;s
Terabon. He&#8217;s a good sport, too, and he&#8217;ll be better
when I&#8217;ve&mdash;when I&#8217;ve caught him.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon was just a raw young man as regards women.
He might flatter himself that he knew her sex,
and that he could maintain a pose of writing her into
his notebooks, but she knew. She had seen stunned
and helpless youth as she brought into play those subtle
arts which had wrenched from his reluctant and fearful
soul the kiss which he thought he had asked for, and
the phrase of the river goddess, which he thought
he had invented. She laughed, for she had realized,
as she acted, that he would put into words the subtle
name for which she had played.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It all seemed so easy now that she considered the sequence
of her inspired moves. Drifting near another
shanty-boat, she passed the time of day with a runaway
couple who had come down the Ohio. They had dinner
together on their boat. A solitaire and an unscarred
wedding ring attested to the respectability of the association.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Larry&#8217;s a river drifter,&#8221; the girl explained, &#8220;and
Daddy&#8217;s one of those set old fellows who hate the
river. But Mamma knew it was all right. Larry&#8217;s
saved $7,000 in three years. He&#8217;d never tell me that
till I married him, but I knew. We&#8217;re going clear down
to N&#8217;Orleans. Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And all alone&mdash;aren&#8217;t you afraid?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll be all right, won&#8217;t I?&#8221; She looked at the
stern-featured youth.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;If you can shoot and don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Larry replied
without a smile.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I can shoot,&#8221; Nelia said, showing her pistol.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s river Law!&#8221; Larry cried, smiling. &#8220;That&#8217;s
Law. You came out the Upper River?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she nodded.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Then I bet&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; the girl-wife started to speak,
but stopped, blushing.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Nelia smiled a hard smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m the woman
who shot Prebol above Buffalo Island&mdash;I had to.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You did right; men always respect a lady if she
don&#8217;t care who she shoots,&#8221; Larry cried, enthusiastically.
&#8220;Wish you&#8217;d get my wife to learn how to
shoot. She&#8217;s gun shy!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So Nelia coaxed the little wife to shoot, first the 22-calibre
repeating rifle and then the pistol. When
Nelia had to go down they parted good friends and
Larry thanked her, saying that probably they would
meet down below somewhere.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;ll make Caruthersville,&#8221; Larry told her.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a good eddy on the east side across from the
town. There&#8217;s likely some boats in there. They&#8217;ll
know, perhaps, if the folks you are looking for are
around. There&#8217;s an old river man there now, name of
Buck. He&#8217;s a gambler, but he&#8217;s all right, and he&#8217;ll
treat you all right. He&#8217;s from up in our country, on
the Ohio. Hardly anybody knows about him. He was
always a dandy fellow, but he married a woman that
wasn&#8217;t fit to drink his coffee. She bothered the life
out of him, and&mdash;well, he squared up. He gave her
to the other fellow with a double-barrelled shotgun.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When Nelia ran down to the gambling boat and
found Parson Rasba there, she enjoyed the idea. Certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
the River Prophet and the river gambler were an
interesting combination. She was not prepared to
find that Buck had taken his departure and that Parson
Rasba was converting the gambling hell into a mission
boat. Least of all was she prepared when Parson Rasba
said with an unsteady voice:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Theh&#8217;s a man sick in that other boat, and likely
he&#8217;d like to see somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, if there&#8217;s anything I can do!&#8221; she exclaimed, as
a woman does.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He led the way to the brick-red little boat, the like
of which could be found in a thousand river eddies.
She followed him on board and over to the bed. There
she looked into the wan countenance and startled
eyes of Jest Prebol.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s Mister Prebol,&#8221; Rasba said. &#8220;I know you
have no hard feelings against him, and I know he has
none against you, Missy Carline!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>An introduction to a contrite river pirate, whom she
had shot, for the moment rendered the young woman
speechless. Prebol was less at loss for words.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to git to see yo&#8217;,&#8221; he said, feebly. &#8220;If
I&#8217;d knowed yo&#8217;, I shore would have minded my own
business. I&#8217;m bad, Missy Carline, but I ain&#8217; mean&mdash;not
much. Leastwise, not about women. I reckon
the boys shore will let yo&#8217; be now. I made a mistake,
an&#8217; I &#8217;low to &#8217;pologise to yo&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I was&mdash;I was scairt to death,&#8221; she cried, sitting
in a chair. &#8220;I was all alone. I was afraid&mdash;the
river was so big that night. I was so far away. I
should have given you fair warning. I&#8217;m sorry, too,
Jest.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Lawse!&#8221; Prebol choked. &#8220;Say hit thataway
ag&#8217;in&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, too, Jest!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I cayn&#8217;t thank yo&#8217; all enough,&#8221; the man-whispered.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got friends along down the riveh. I&#8217;ll
send word along to them, they&#8217;ll shore treat yo&#8217; nice.
Treat friends of yourn nice, too. Huh! &#8217;Pologizin&#8217;
to me afteh what I &#8217;lowed to do!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be good friends, Jest. The Prophet here
and I are good friends, too. Aren&#8217;t we, Parson?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I hearn say, Missy,&#8221; the Prophet said, slowly,
picking his words, &#8220;I hearn say you&#8217;ve a power and a
heap of book learning! Books on yo&#8217; boat, all kinds.
What favoured yo&#8217; thataway?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, I read lots!&#8221; she exclaimed, surprised by the
sudden shift of thought. &#8220;Somehow, I&#8217;ve read lots!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;In my house I had a Bible, an almanac, and the
&#8216;Resources of Tennessee,&#8217; Yo&#8217; have that many
books?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve a hundred&mdash;more than a hundred
books!&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A Bible?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Would you mind, Missy, comin&#8217; on board this boat
to-night, an&#8217; tellin&#8217; us about these books you have?
I&#8217;m not educated; my daddy an&#8217; I read the Bible,
an&#8217; tried to understand hit. Seems like we neveh did
git to know the biggest and bestest of the words.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You had a dictionary?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A which?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A dictionary, a book that explains the meaning
of all the words!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Ho law! A book that tells what words mean, Missy.
Where all kin a man git to find one of them books?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve got&#8211;&#8211;I&#8217;m hungry, Mr. Rasba, I must
get something to eat. After supper we&#8217;ll bring some
books over here and talk about them!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;My supper is all ready, keeping warm in the oven,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Rasba said. &#8220;I always cook enough for one more
than there is. Yo&#8217; know, a vacant chair at the table
for the Stranger.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And I came?&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;An&#8217; yo&#8217; came, Missy!&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Parson,&#8221; Prebol pleaded, &#8220;I&#8217;m alone mos&#8217; the
time. Mout yo&#8217; two eat hyar on my bo&#8217;t? The table&mdash;hit&#8217;d
be comp&#8217;ny.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Certainly we&#8217;ll come,&#8221; Nelia promised, &#8220;if he&#8217;d
just soon.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather,&#8221; Rasba assented, and at his tone Nelia
felt a curious sensation of pity and mischievousness.
At the same time, she recovered her self-possession.
She demanded that Rasba let her help him bring over
the supper, add a feminine relish, and set the table
with a daintiness which was an addition to the fascination
of her presence. Gaily she fed Prebol the delicate
things which he was permitted to eat, then sat down
with Rasba, her face to the light, and Prebol could
watch her bantering, teasing, teaching Parson Rasba
things he had never known he lacked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>After supper she brought over a basket full of books,
twenty volumes. She dumped them onto the table,
leather, cloth, and board covers, of red, blue, gray,
brown, and other gay colours. Parson Rasba had seen
government documents and even some magazines with
picture covers, but in the mountains where he had ridden
his Big Circuit with such a disastrous end he had never
seen such books. He hesitated to touch one; he cried out
when three or four slipped off the pile onto the floor.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Missy, won&#8217;t they git muddied up!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They&#8217;re to read!&#8221; she told him. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; and
she began to read&mdash;poetry, prose at random.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The Prophet did not know, he had never been trained
to know&mdash;as few men ever are trained&mdash;how to combat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
feminine malice and spoiled power. He listened,
but not with averted eyes. Prebol, himself a spectator
at a scene different from any he had ever witnessed,
was still enough more sophisticated to know what she
was doing, and he was delighted.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>By and by the injured man drifted into slumber,
but Rasba gave no sign of flagging interest, no traces
of a mind astray from the subject at hand. He felt
that he must make the most of this revelation, which
came after the countless revelations which he had had
since arriving down the river. There was a fear
clutching at his heart that it might end; that in a moment
this woman might depart and leave him unenlightened,
and unable ever to find for himself the unimaginable
world of words which she plucked out of those
books and pinned into the great vacant spaces of his
mind which he had kept empty all these years&mdash;not
knowing that he was waiting for this night, when he
should have the Mississippi bring into his eddy, alongside
his own mission boat, what he most needed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He sat there, a great, pathetic figure, shaggy, his
heart thumping, taking from this trim, neat, beautiful
woman the riches which she so casually, almost wantonly,
threw to him in passing.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The corridors of his mind echoed to the tread of hosts;
he heard the rumblings of history, the songs of poets
whose words are pitched to the music of the skies, and
he hung word pictures which Ruskin had painted in his
imagination.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Fate had waited long to give him this night. It had
waited till the man was ready, then with a lavish hand
the storehouses of the master intellects of the world
were opened to him, for him to help himself. Nelia
suddenly started up from her chair and looked around,
herself the victim of her own raillery, which had grown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
to be an understanding of the pathetic hunger of the
man for these things.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was daylight, and the flood of the sunrise was at hand.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Parson,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do you like these things&mdash;these
books?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Missy,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;I could near repeat, word for
word, all those things you&#8217;ve said and read to me to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;There are lots more,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I want to do
something for your mission boat, will you let me?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Lawse! Yo&#8217;ve he&#8217;ped me now more&#8217;n yo&#8217; know!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She smiled the smile that women have had from all
the ages, for she knew a thousand times more than even
the Prophet.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a set of all these books!&#8221; she said;
&#8220;all the books that I have. Not these, my old pals&mdash;yes,
these books, Mr. Rasba. If you&#8217;ll take them?
I&#8217;ll get another lot down below.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Lawd God! Give me yo&#8217; books!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re not expensive&mdash;they&#8217;re&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They&#8217;re yours. Cayn&#8217;t yo&#8217; see? It&#8217;s your own
books, an&#8217; hit&#8217;s fo&#8217; my work. I neveh knowed how
good men could be, an&#8217; they give me that boat fo&#8217; a
mission boat. Now&mdash;now&mdash;missy&mdash;I cayn&#8217;t tell yo&#8217;&mdash;I&#8217;ve
no words&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>And with gratitude, with the simplicity of a mountain
parson, he dropped on his knees and thanked God.
As he told his humility, Prebol wakened from a deep
and restful sleep to listen in amazement.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When at last Rasba looked up Nelia was gone.
The books were on the table and he found another stack
heaped up on the deck of the mission boat. But the
woman was gone, and when he looked down the river
he saw something flicker and vanish in the distance.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He stared, hurt; he choked, for a minute, in protest,
then carried that immeasurable treasure into his cabin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Renn Doss, the false friend, saw the danger of
the recognition of the firearms by Carline.
The savage swing of a half pound of fine shot
braided up in a rawhide bag, and a good aim, reduced
Carline to an inert figure of a man. &#8220;Renn Doss&#8221;
was Hilt Despard, pirate captain, whose instantaneous
action always had served him well in moments of peril.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The three men carried Carline to a bunk and dropped
him on it. They covered him up and emptied a cupful
of whiskey on his pillow and clothes. They even
poured a few spoonfuls down his throat. They thus
changed him to what might be called a &#8220;natural condition.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then, sitting around the stove, they whispered among
themselves, discussing what they had better do. Half
a hundred possibilities occurred to their fertile fancies
and replete memories. Men and women who have
always led sheltered lives can little understand or
know what a pirate must understand and know even
to live let alone be successful.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What&#8217;s Terabon up to?&#8221; Despard demanded.
&#8220;Here he is, drappin&#8217; down by Fort Pillow Landing,
running around. Where&#8217;s that girl he had up above
New Madrid? What&#8217;s his game? Coming up here
and talking to us? Asking us all about the river and
things&mdash;writin&#8217; it for the newspapers?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That woman&#8217;s this Carline&#8217;s wife!&#8221; Jet sneered.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sure! An&#8217; here&#8217;s Terabon an&#8217; here&#8217;s Carline.
Terabon don&#8217;t talk none about that woman&mdash;nor about
Carline,&#8221; Dock grumbled.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I bet Terabon would be sorry none if Carline hyar
dropped out. Y&#8217; know she&#8217;s Old Crele&#8217;s gal,&#8221; Jet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
said. &#8220;Crele&#8217;s a good feller. Sent word down to
have us take cyar of her, an&#8217; Prebol, the fool, didn&#8217;t
know &#8217;er, hadn&#8217;t heard. Look what she give him, bang
in the shoulder! That old Prophet&#8217;ll take cyar of him,
course. See how hit works out. She shined up to
Terabon, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I &#8217;low I better talk to him,&#8221; Despard suggested.
&#8220;Terabon&#8217;s a good sport. He said, you&#8217; know, that
graftin&#8217; and whiskey boatin&#8217;, an&#8217; robbin&#8217; the bank
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t none of his business. He said, course, he could
write it down in his notes, but without names, &#8217;count
of somebody might read somethin&#8217; in them an&#8217; get
some good friend of his in Dutch. He said it wouldn&#8217;t
be right for him to know about somebody robbin&#8217;
a commissary, or a bank, or killin&#8217; somebody, because
if somebody like a sheriff or detective got onto it, they
might blame him, or somethin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I like that Terabon!&#8221; Jet declared. &#8220;Y&#8217;see how he is.
He says he&#8217;s satisfied, makin&#8217; a fair living, gettin&#8217;
notes so&#8217;s he can write them magazine stories, an&#8217; if
he was to try to rob the banks, he&#8217;d have to learn
how, same&#8217;s writin&#8217; for newspapers. An&#8217; probably he
wouldn&#8217;t have the nerve to do it really, &#8217;count of his
maw and paw bein&#8217; the kind they was. He told me
hisself that they made him go to Sunday school when
he was a kid, an&#8217; things like that spoil a man for graftin&#8217;.
Stands to reason, all right, the way he talks. I like
him; he knows enough to mind his own business.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;s comin&#8217; up to-night to go after geese on the
bar. We&#8217;ll talk to him. He&#8217;ll look that business over,
level-headed. That motorboat any good?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; extra. He&#8217;s got ready money, though,
I forgot that,&#8221; Despard grinned, walking over to the
hapless victim of his black-jack skill.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The three divided nearly thirteen hundred dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
among them. The money made them good humoured
and they had some compassion for their prisoner.
One of them noticed that a skiff was coming up from
Fort Pillow Landing, and fifteen minutes later Terabon
was talking to Despard on the snag to one prong of
which was fastened the line of Carline&#8217;s motorboat.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I was wondering where I&#8217;d see you again,&#8221; Terabon
said. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t have a chance at New Madrid, saw
you was in business, so I didn&#8217;t follow up none.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I was wondering if you had a line on that,&#8221; Despard
said, doubtfully. &#8220;Y&#8217;know that woman you was
staying with up on Island Ten Bar? Well, we got
her man in here full&#8217;s a fish. Lookin&#8217; for his woman,
an&#8217; he&#8217;s no good. Fell off the cabin, hit a spark in the
back of the head when the water sucked when that
steamboat went by this morning. He&#8217;d ought to go
down to Memphis hospital, but&mdash;Well, we can&#8217;t
take &#8217;im. You know how that is.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Be glad to help you boys out any way I can,&#8221;
Terabon said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll run him down.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Say, would you? We don&#8217;t want him on our
hands,&#8221; the pirate explained. &#8220;We&#8217;d get to see you
down b&#8217;low some&#8217;rs.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sure, I would,&#8221; Terabon exclaimed. &#8220;Fact is,
the woman said it&#8217;d be a favour to her, too, if I&#8217;d get
him home. She&#8217;ll be dropping down likely. Darn
nice girl, but quick tempered.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; quick ain&#8217;t no name for it. She
plugged a friend of mine up by Buffalo Island&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Prebol? I heard about him. She was scairt.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;She needn&#8217;t be, never again!&#8221; Despard grinned.
&#8220;When a lady can handle a river Law like she does,
us bad uns are real nice!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon laughed, and the two went into the cabin-boat
where Carline lay on the bunk. Terabon ran his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
hand around the man&#8217;s head and neck, found the lump
near the base of the skull, found that the neck wasn&#8217;t
broken, and made sure that the heart was beating&mdash;things
a reporter naturally learns to do in police-station
and hospital experience.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Jet brought the motorboat down to the stern of the
cabin-boat, and the four carried Carline on board.
They put him in his bunk, and Terabon, his skiff towing
astern, steered out into the main current and soon
faded down by Craighead Point Bar.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I knowed he&#8217;d be all right,&#8221; Despard declared.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll take him down to Memphis, and out of our way.
I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; hated to kill him; it ain&#8217;t no use killin&#8217; a man
less&#8217;n it&#8217;s necessary. We got what we was after.
Course, if we&#8217;d rewarded him, likely we&#8217;d got a lot,
but it ain&#8217;t safe, holdin&#8217; a man for rewards ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That boat&#8217;d been a good one to travel in,&#8221; Jet
suggested.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Everybody&#8217;d knowed it was Carline&#8217;s, an&#8217; it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
worth fixing over. Hull not much good, and the
motor&#8217;s been abused some. We&#8217;ll do better&#8217;n that.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They had rid themselves of an incumbrance. They
had made an acquaintance who was making himself
useful. They were considerably richer than they had
been for some time.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to drap into Mendova,&#8221; Jet mused. &#8220;We
ain&#8217;t had what you&#8217;d call a time&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Let&#8217;s kill some birds first,&#8221; Gaspard suggested.
&#8220;I got a hunch that Yankee Bar&#8217;s a good bet for us
for a little while. We dassn&#8217;t look into Memphis,
&#8217;count of last trip down. Mendova&#8217;s all right, but
wait&#8217;ll we&#8217;ve hunted Yankee Bar.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The money burned in their pockets, but as they stood
looking out at the long, beautiful Yankee Bar its appeal
went home. For more than a hundred years
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
generations of pirates had used there, and no one knows
how many tragedies have left their stain in the great
band around from Gold Dust Landing to Chickasaw
Bluffs No. 1.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>After dark they rowed over to the point and put out
their decoys, dug their pits, screened them, and brushed
over their tracks in the sand. Then they played cards
till midnight, turned in for a little sleep, and turned out
again in the black morning to go to their places with
repeating shotguns and cripple-killer rifles in their
hands.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When they were in their places, and the river silence
prevailed, they saw the stars overhead, the reflections
on sand and water around them, and the quivering
change as air currents moved in the dark&mdash;the things
that walk in the night. They heard, at intervals,
many voices. Some they knew as the fluent music
of migrant geese flying over on long laps of their fall
flight, but some they did not know, except that they
were river voices.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Ducks flew by no higher than the tops of the willow
trees up the bar, their wings whistling and their voices
eager in the dark. The lurkers saw these birds darting
by like black streaks, tempting vain shots, but they
were old hunters, and knew they wanted at least a little
light. Over on the mainland they heard the noises of
wilderness animals, and away off yonder a mule&#8217;s
&#8220;he-haw&#8221; reverberated through the bottoms and over
bars and river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For these things, if the pirates had only known it,
they found the world endurable. Each in his own pit,
given over to his own thoughts, they thrilled to the joy
of living. All they wanted, really, was this kind of
thing; hunting in fall and winter, fishing in the summer,
and occasional visits to town for another kind of thrill,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
another sort of excitement. But their boyhood had
been passed in privation, their youth amid temptations
of appetite and vice, and now they were hopelessly
mixed as to what they liked, what they didn&#8217;t like, what
the world would do for them, and what they would do
to the world. Weaklings, uneducated, without balance;
habit-ridden, yet with all that miserable inheritance
from the world, they waited there rigid, motionless,
their hearts thrilling to the increasing music of the
march of dawn across the bottoms of the Mississippi.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>False dawn flushed and faded almost like a deliberate
lightning flash. Then dawn appeared, marking down
the gray lines of the wilderness trees with one stroke,
sweeping out all the stars with another brush, revealing
the flocks of birds glistening against the sky while yet
the earth was in shade. The watchers spied a score of
birds, great geese far to the northward, coming right
in line with them. They waited for a few seconds&mdash;ages
long. Then one of the men cried:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They&#8217;re stoopin&#8217;, boys! They&#8217;re comin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The wild geese, coming down a magnificent slant
from a mile height, headed straight for Yankee Bar.
Will birds never learn? They ploughed down with their
wings folding, and poised. Their voices grew louder
and louder as they approached.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>With a hissing roar of their wings they pounded down
out of the great, safe heights and circled around and inward.
With a shout the three men started up through
their masks and with levelled guns opened fire.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Too late the old gander at the point of the &#8220;V&#8221; began
to climb; too late the older birds in the point screamed
and gathered their strength. The river men turned
their black muzzles against the necks of the young
tail birds of the feathered procession and brought
them tumbling down out of the line to the ground,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
where on the hard sand two of them split their breasts
and exposed thick layers of fat dripping with oil.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The cries of the fleeing birds, the echoes of the barking
guns, died away. The men shouted their joy in
their success, gathered up their victims, scurried pack
to cover, brushing over their tracks, and crouched down
again, to await another flock.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Hunger drove them to their cabin-boat within an
hour. They had thought they wanted to get some
more birds, but in fact they knew they had enough.
They went over to their boat, cooked up a big breakfast,
and sat around the fire smoking and talking it over.
They chattered like boys. They were gleeful, innocent,
harmless! But only for a time. Then the
hunted feeling returned to them. Once more they had a
back track to watch and ambushes to be wary of. They
wanted to go to Mendova, but again they didn&#8217;t want
to go there. They didn&#8217;t know but what Mendova
might be watching for them, the same as Memphis
was. Certainly, they determined, they must go to
Mendova after dark, and see a friend who would put
them wise to actual conditions around town.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They took catnaps, having had too little sleep, and
yet they could not sleep deeply. They watched the
shanty-boats which dropped down the river at intervals,
most of them in the main current close to the far
bank, and often hardly visible against the mottled
background of caving earth, fallen trees, and flickering
mirage. Their restlessness was silent, morose, and
one of them was always on the lookout.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Despard himself was on watch in the afternoon.
He sat just inside the kitchen door, out of the sunshine,
in a comfortable rocking chair. Two windows and the
stern door gave him a wide view of the river, sandbars
and eddy. It seemed but a minute, but he had fallen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
into a doze, when the splash of a shanty-boat sweeps
awakened all the crew with a sudden, frightened start.
Whispers, hardly audible, hailed in alarm. The three,
crouching in involuntary doubt and dismay, glared at
the newcomer.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was a woman drifting in. Apparently she intended
to land there, and the three men stared at her.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;His wife!&#8221; Despard said with soundless lips. The
others nodded their recognition.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Mrs. Carline had run into the great dead eddy at
the foot of Yankee Lower Bar, turned up in the slow
reverse eddy of the chute, and was coming by their boat
at the slowest possible speed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Despard pulled his soft shirt collar, straightened his
tie, hitched his suspenders, put on his coat, walked out
on the stern deck, and, after a glance around, seemed
suddenly to discover the stranger.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Howdy!&#8221; he nodded, touching his cap respectfully,
and gazing with flickering eyes at the woman whose
marksmanship entitled her to the greatest respect.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Howdy!&#8221; she nodded, scrutinizing him with level
eyes. &#8220;Where am I?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yankee Bar. Them&#8217;s Chickasaw Bluffs No. 1.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Do you know Jest Prebol?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yessum.&#8221; Despard&#8217;s head bobbed in alarmed, unwilling
assent.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I thought perhaps you&#8217;d like to know that he&#8217;s getting
along all right.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I bet he learnt his lesson,&#8221; Despard grimaced.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What? I don&#8217;t just understand.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;About bein&#8217; impudent to a lady that can shoot&mdash;straight!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A flicker moved the woman&#8217;s countenance, and she
smiled, oddly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, any one is likely to make mistakes!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Darn fools is, Miss Crele. And you Old Crele&#8217;s
girl! He might of knowed!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The other two stepped out to help enjoy the conversation
and the scenery.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You know me?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yessum, we shore do. My name&#8217;s Despard&mdash;Jet
here and Cope.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She acknowledged the introductions.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ve friends down here,&#8221; she said, with a little
catch of her breath. &#8220;I was wondering if you&mdash;any
of you gentlemen had seen them?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Your man, Gus Carline an&#8217; that writin&#8217; feller, Terabon?&#8221;
Jet asked, without delicacy. Her cheeks
flamed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Terabon took him down to Mendova or Memphis,&#8221;
Despard said. &#8220;Carline was&mdash;was on the cabin and
the boat lurched when the steamboat passing drawed.
He drapped over and hit a spark plug on the head!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Was he badly hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Not much&mdash;kind of a lump, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She looked down at Fort Pillow Bluff. The pirates
awaited her pleasure, staring at her to their heart&#8217;s
content. They envied her husband and Terabon; they
felt the strangeness of the situation. She was following
those two men down. She was part of the river tide,
drifting by; she had shot Prebol, their pal, and had
cleverly ascertained their knowledge of him while insuring
that they had fair warning.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Her boat drifted down till it was opposite them, and
then, with quick decision, she caught up a handy
line, and said:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tie in a little while. I&#8217;ve been alone

fast. They swung her boat in, ran a plank from stern
to bow, and Despard gave her his hand. She came on
board, and they sat on the stern deck to talk. Only
one kind of woman could have done that with safety,
but she was that kind. She had shot a man down for a
look.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The three pirates took one of the fat young geese,

she had told them about Prebol, about Parson Rasba
introducing them. The pirates shouted when she told
of Jest&#8217;s apology. With river frankness, they said they
thought a heap of Terabon, who minded his own business
so cleverly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I like him, too,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;I was afraid you
boys might make trouble for Carline, though. He

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of those ignorant Up-the-Bankers,&#8221; Despard

little bitterly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As they ate the goose in camaraderie, the pirates took
to warning and advising her about the Lower River;
they told her who would treat her right, and who
wouldn&#8217;t. They especially warned her against stopping
anywhere near Island 37.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They&#8217;re bad there&mdash;and mean.&#8221; Despard shook
his head, gravely.</p>

What kind of a boat?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A gasolene cruiser.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Did he say where he&#8217;d be?&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Parson Rasba piled the books on the crap
table in his cabin and stood them in rows with
their lettered backs up. He read their titles,
which were fascinating: &#8220;Arabian Nights,&#8221; &#8220;Representative
Men,&#8221; &#8220;Plutarch&#8217;s Lives,&#8221; &#8220;Modern Painters,&#8221;
&#8220;Romany Rye&#8221;&mdash;a name that made him shudder,
for it meant some terrible kind of whiskey to his mind&mdash;&#8220;Lavengro,&#8221;
a foreign thing, &#8220;Thesaurus of English
Words and Phrases,&#8221; &#8220;The Stem Dictionary,&#8221; &#8220;Working
Principles of Rhetoric&#8221;&mdash;he wondered what rhetoric
meant&mdash;&#8220;The Fur Buyers&#8217; Guide,&#8221; &#8220;Stones of
Venice,&#8221; &#8220;The French Revolution,&#8221; &#8220;Sartor Resartus,&#8221;
&#8220;Poe&#8217;s Works,&#8221; &#8220;Balzac&#8217;s Tales,&#8221; and scores of other
titles.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>All at once the Mississippi had brought down to
him these treasures and a fair woman with blue eyes and
a smile of understanding and sympathy, who had handed
them to him, saying:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I want to do something for your mission boat;
will you let me?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>No fairyland, no enchantment, no translation from
poverty and sorrow to a realm of wealth and happiness
could have caught the soul of the Prophet Rasba as
this revelation of unimagined, undreamed-of riches as he
plucked the fruits of learning and enjoyed their luxuries.
He had descended in his humility to the last,
least task for which he felt himself worthy. He had
humbly been grateful for even that one thing left for
him to do: find Jock Drones for his mother.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had found Jock, and there had been no wrestling
with an obdurate spirit to send him back home, like
a man, to face the law and accept the penalty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
There had been nothing to it. Jock had seen the light
instantly, and with relief. His partner had also turned
back after a decade of doubt and misery, to live a man&#8217;s
part &#8220;back home.&#8221; The two of them had handed him
a floating Bethel, turning their gambling hell over to
him as though it were a night&#8217;s lodging, or a snack, or a
handful of hickory nuts. The temple of his fathers
had been no better for its purpose than this beautiful,
floating boat.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then a woman had come floating down, a beautiful
strange woman whose voice had clutched at his heart,
whose smile had deprived him of reason, whose eyes had
searched his soul. With tears on her lashes she had
flung to him that treasure-store of learning, and gone
on her way, leaving him strength and consolation.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He left his treasure and went out to look at the river.
Everybody leaves everything to look at the river!
There is nothing in the world that will prevent it. He
saw, in the bright morning, that Prebol had raised his
curtain, and was looking at the river, too, though the
effort must have caused excruciating pain in his wounded
shoulder. Day was growing; from end to end of that
vast, flowing sheet of water thousands upon thousands
of old river people were taking a look at the Mississippi.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba carried a good broth over to Prebol for breakfast,
and then returned to his cabin, having made
Prebol comfortable and put a dozen of the wonderful
books within his reach. Then the River Prophet sat
down to read his treasures, any and all of them, his lap
piled up, three or four books in one hand and trying to
turn the pages of another in his other hand by unskilful
manipulation of his thumb. He was literally
starving for the contents of those books.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He was afraid that his treasure would escape from him;
he kept glancing from his printed page to the serried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
ranks on the crap table, and his hands unconsciously
felt around to make sure that the weight on his lap and
in his grasp was substantial and real, and not a dream
or vision of delight.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He forgot to eat; he forgot that he had not slept; he
sat oblivious of time and river, the past or the future;
he grappled with pages of print, with broadsides of
pictures, with new and thrilling words, with sentences
like hammer blows, with paragraphs that marched like
music, with thoughts that had the gay abandon of a
bird in song. And the things he learned!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When night fell he was dismayed by his weariness,
and could not understand it. For a little while he ransacked
his dulled wits to find the explanation, and when
he had fixed Prebol for the night, with medicine, water,
and a lamp handy to matches, he told the patient:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Seems like the gimp&#8217;s kind of took out of me. My
eyes are sore, an&#8217; I doubt am I quite well.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Likely yo&#8217; didn&#8217;t sleep well,&#8221; Prebol suggested.
&#8220;A man cayn&#8217;t sleep days if he ain&#8217;t used to hit.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sleep days?&#8221; Rasba looked wildly about him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho! When did I git to sleep, why, I ain&#8217;t slept&mdash;I&#8211;&#8211;Lawse!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Prebol laughed aloud.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yo&#8217; see, Parson, yo&#8217; all cayn&#8217;t set up all night with a
pretty gal an&#8217; not sleep hit off. Yo&#8217; shore&#8217;ll git tired,
sportin&#8217; aroun&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; Rasba snapped, and then a smile broke across
his countenance. He cried out with laughter, and admitted:
&#8220;Hit&#8217;s seo, Prebol! I neveh set up with a gal
befo&#8217; I come down the riveh. Lawse! I plumb forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; Prebol replied, gravely. &#8220;She&#8217;d
make any man forget. She sung me to sleep, an&#8217; I
slept like I neveh slept befo&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba went on board his boat and, after a light supper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
turned in. For a minute he saw in retrospect the
most wonderful day in his life, a day which a kindly
Providence had drawn through thirty or forty hours of
unforgettable exaltation. Then he settled into the blank,
deep sleep of a soul at peace and at rest.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When in the full tide of the sunshine he awakened, he
went about his menial tasks, attending Prebol, cleaning
out the boats, shaking up the beds, hanging the bedclothes
to air in the sun, and getting breakfast. On
Prebol&#8217;s suggestion he moved the fleet of boats out into
the eddy, for the river was falling and they might
ground. He went over to Caruthersville and bought
some supplies, brought Doctor Grell over to examine
the patient to make sure all was well, killed several
squirrels and three ducks back in the brakes, and, all
the while, thought what duties he should enter upon.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Doctor Grell advised that Prebol go down to Memphis,
to the hospital, so as to have an X-ray examination,
and any special treatment which might be necessary.
The wound was healing nicely, but it would be
better to make sure.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba took counsel of Prebol. The river man knew
the needs of the occasion, and he agreed that he had
better drop down to Memphis or Mendova, preferring
the latter place, for he knew people there. He told
Rasba to line the two small shanty-boats beside the big
mission boat, and fend them off with wood chunks.
The skiffs could float on lines alongside or at the stern.
The power boat could tow the fleet out into the current,
and hold it off sandbars or flank the bends.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba did as he was bid, and lashed the boats together
with mooring lines, pin-head to towing bits, and
side to side. Then he floated the boats all on one
anchor line, and ran the launch up to the bow. He
hoisted in the anchor, rowed in a skiff out to the motorboat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
and swung wide in the eddy to run out to the river
current. There was a good deal of work to the task,
and it was afternoon before the fleet reached the main
stream.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then Rasba cast off his tow lines, ran the launch
back to the fleet, and made it fast to the port bow of the
big boat, so that it was part of the fleet, with its
power available to shove ahead or astern. A big oar
on the mission boat&#8217;s bow and another one out from
Prebol&#8217;s boat insured a short turn if it should be necessary
to swing the boats around either way.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba carried Prebol on his cot up to the bow of the
big boat, and put him down where he could help watch
the river, and they cast off. Prebol knew the bends and
reaches, and named most of the landings; they gossiped
about the people and the places. Prebol told how river
rats sometimes stole hogs or cattle for food, and Rasba
learned for the first time of organized piracy, of river
men who were banded together for stealing what they
could, raiding river towns, attacking &#8220;sports,&#8221; tripping
the river, and even more desperate enterprises.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>While he talked, Prebol slyly watched his listener and
thought for a long time that Rasba was merely dumbfounded
by the atrocities, but at last the Prophet
grinned:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;An&#8217; yo&#8217;s a riveh rat. Ho law!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t say&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; Prebol began, but his words
faltered.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yo&#8217; know right smart about such things,&#8221; Rasba
reminded him. &#8220;I &#8217;low hit were about time somebody
shot yo&#8217; easy, so&#8217;s to give yo&#8217; repentance a chance to
catch up with yo&#8217; wickedness. Don&#8217;t yo&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Prebol glared at the accusation, but Rasba pretended
not to notice.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yo&#8217; see, Prebol, this world is jes&#8217; the hounds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
a-chasin&#8217; the rabbits, er the rabbits a-gittin&#8217; out the way.
The good that&#8217;s into a man keeps a-runnin&#8217;, to git shut
of the sin that&#8217;s in him, an&#8217; theh&#8217;s a heap of wrestlin&#8217;
when one an&#8217; tother catches holt an&#8217; fights.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s seo!&#8221; Prebol admitted, reluctantly. He
didn&#8217;t have much use for religious arguments. &#8220;I
wisht yo&#8217;d read them books to me, Parson. I ain&#8217;t
neveh had much eddycation. I&#8217;ll watch the riveh, an&#8217;
warn ye, &#8217;gin we make the crossin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nothing suited them better. Rasba read aloud,
stabbing each word with his finger while he sought the
range and rhythm of the sentences, and, as they happened
to strike a book of fables, their minds could grasp
the stories and the morals at least sufficiently to entertain
and hold their attention.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Prebol said, warningly, after a time:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Betteh hit that sweep a lick, Parson, she&#8217;s a-swingin&#8217;
in onto that bar p&#8217;int.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A few leisurely strokes, the boats drifted away into
deep water, and Rasba expressed his admiration.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho, Prebol! Yo&#8217; seen that bar a mile up. We&#8217;d
run down onto hit.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh,&#8221; the wounded man grinned. &#8220;Three-four
licks on the oars up theh, and down yeah yo&#8217; save
pullin&#8217; yo&#8217; livin&#8217; daylights out, to keep from goin&#8217; onto
a sandbar or into a dryin&#8217;-up chute.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; Rasba cocked his ear. &#8220;Say hit
oveh&mdash;slow!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, if yo&#8217;s into the set of the current up theh, hit
ain&#8217;t strong; yo&#8217; jes&#8217; give two-three licks an&#8217; yo&#8217;
send out clear. Down theh on the bar she draws yo&#8217;
right into shallow water, an&#8217; yo&#8217; hang up.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba looked up the river; he looked down at the
nearing sandbar, and as they passed the rippling head
in safety he turned a grave face toward the pilot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Up theh, theh wasn&#8217;t much suck to hit, but down

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Jes&#8217; so!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s easy to git shut of sin, away long in the beginnin&#8217;,&#8221;
Rasba bit his words out, &#8220;but when yo&#8217; git a
long ways down into hit&mdash;Ho law!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Prebol started, caught by surprise. Then both
laughed together. They could understand each other
better and if Prebol felt himself being drawn in spite of
his own reluctance by a new current in his life, Rasba
did not fail to gratify the river man&#8217;s pride by turning
always to him for advice about the river, its currents
and its jeopardies.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ve tripped down with all kinds,&#8221; Prebol grinned
as he spoke, &#8220;but this yeah&#8217;s the firstest time I eveh
did get to pilot a mission boat.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;If you take it through in safety, do yo&#8217; reckon God
will forget?&#8221; Rasba asked, and Prebol&#8217;s jaw dropped.
He didn&#8217;t want to be reformed; he had no use for religion.
He was very well satisfied with his own way of living.
He objected to being prayed over and the good of his
soul inquired into&mdash;but this Parson Rasba was making
the idea interesting.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They anchored for the night in the eddy at the head
of Needham&#8217;s Cut-Off Bar, and Prebol was soon asleep,
but Rasba sat under the big lamp and read. He could
read with continuity now; dread that the dream would
vanish no longer afflicted him. He could read a book
without having more than two or three other books in
his lap.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Sometimes it was almost as though Nelia were speaking
the very words he read; sometimes he seemed to
catch her frown of disapproval. The books, more
precious than any other treasure could have been,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
seemed living things because she had owned them,
because her pencil had marked them, and because she
had given them all to his service, to fill the barren and
hungry places in the long-empty halls of his mind.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He would stop his reading to think, and thinking, he
would take up a book to discover better how to think.
He found that his reading and thinking worked together
for his own information.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He was musing, his mind enjoying the novelty of so
many different images and ideas and facts, when
something trickled among his senses and stirred his
consciousness into alert expectancy. For a little he
was curious, and then touched by dismay, for it was
music which had roused him&mdash;music out of the black
river night. People about to die sometimes hear music,
and Parson Rasba unconsciously braced himself for the
shock.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It grew louder, however, more distinct, and the sound
was too gay and lively to fit in with his dreams of a heavenly
choir. He caught the shout of a human voice
and he knew that dancers were somewhere, perhaps
dancers damned to eternal mirth. He went out on
the deck and closed the door on the light behind him;
at first he could see nothing but black night. A little
later he discovered boats coming down the river, eight
or nine gleaming windows, and a swinging light hung
on a flag staff or shanty-boat mast.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As they drew nearer, someone shouted across the
night:</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Ya-s-su-uh!&#8221; Rasba called back.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Three or four sweeps began to beat the water, and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
whole fleet of shanty-boats drifted in slowly. They
began to turn like a wheel as part of them ran into the
eddy while the current carried the others down, but
old river men were at the sweeps, and one of them called
the orders:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Raunch &#8217;er, boys! Raunch &#8217;er! Raunchin&#8217;s what
she needs!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They floated out of the current into the slow reverse
eddy, and coming up close to Rasba&#8217;s fleet, talked back
and forth with him till a gleam of light through a window
struck him clearly out of the dark.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hue-e-e!&#8221; a shrill woman&#8217;s voice laughed. &#8220;Hit&#8217;s

to catch Nelia Crele, Parson?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Did I git to catch Missy Crele!&#8221; he repeated,
dazed.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s the Riveh Prophet,&#8221; someone replied to a
hail from within, the dance ending.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A crowd came tumbling out onto the deck of the big
boat of the dance hall, everyone talking, laughing,
catching their breaths.</p>

his wit turned the laugh into a cheer.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The fleet anchored a hundred yards up the eddy, and
Rasba heard a woman say it was after midnight and
she&#8217;d be blanked if she ever did or would dance on
Sunday. The dance broke up, the noise of voices
lessened, one by one the lights went out, and the eddy
was still again. But the feeling of loneliness was
changed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Lord God, what&#8217;ll I preach to them about?&#8221; Rasba

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Carline ascended into the world again. It
was a painful ascent, and when he looked
around him, he recognized the interior of his
motorboat cabin, heard and felt the throbbing of his
motor, and discovered aches and pains that made his
extremities tingle. He sat up, but the blackness that
seemed to rise around him caused him to fall hastily
back upon the stateroom bunk.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He remembered his discovery of his own firearms
on the shanty-boat, and fear assailed him. He remembered
his folly in crying out that those were his
guns. He might have known he had fallen among
thieves. He cursed himself, and dread of what might
yet follow his indiscretion made him whimper with
terror. A most disgusting odour of whiskey was in his
nostrils, and his throat was like a corrugated iron
pipe partly filled with soot.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The door of the tiny stateroom was closed, but the
two ports were open to let the air in. It occurred to
him that he might be a captive, and would be held for
ransom. Perhaps the pirates would bleed him for
$50,000; perhaps they would take all his fortune! He
began to cry and sob. They might cut his throat, and
not give him any chance of escape. He had heard of
men having had their throats cut down the river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He tried to sit up again, and succeeded without undue
faintness. He could not wait, but must know his
fate immediately. He found the door was unlocked,
and when he slipped out into the cabin, he found that
there was only one man on board, the steersman, who
was sitting in the engine pit, and steering with the rail
wheel instead of the bow-cabin one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He peered out, and found that it was Terabon, who
discovered him and hailed him, cheerily:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;How are you feeling?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Tough&mdash;my head!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;re lucky to be alive!&#8221; Terabon said. &#8220;You
got in with a crew of river pirates, but they let me have
you. Did they leave you anything?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Leave me anything!&#8221; Carline repeated, feeling in his
pockets. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my watch, and here&#8217;s&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He opened up his change pocketbook. There were
six or seven dollars in change and two or three wadded
bills. When he looked for his main supply, however,
there was a difference. The money was all gone.
He was stripped to the last dollar in his money belt
and of his hidden resources.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They did me!&#8221; he choked. &#8220;They got all I had!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t kill you,&#8221; Terabon said. &#8220;You&#8217;re
lucky. How did they bang you and knock you out?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, I found they had my guns on board&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And you accused them?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No! I just said they were mine, I was surprised!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Then?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;My light went out.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;When did they get your guns?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I woke up, up there, and you were gone. My guns
and pocket money were gone, too. I thought&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You thought I&#8217;d robbed you?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Ye&#8211;&#8211;Well, I didn&#8217;t know!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;This is a devil of a river, old man!&#8221; said Terabon.
&#8220;I guess you travelled with the real thing out of New
Madrid&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Doss, Renald Doss. He said he was a sportsman&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Oh, he is, all right, he&#8217;s a familiar type here on the
river. He&#8217;s the kind of a sport who hunts men, Up-the-Bankers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
and game of that kind. He&#8217;s a very successful
hunter, too&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;He said we&#8217;d hunt wild geese. We went up Obion
River, and had lots of fun, and he said he&#8217;d help&mdash;he&#8217;d
help&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Find your wife?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Carline was abject. Terabon, however, was caught
wordless. This man was the husband of the woman
for whose sake he had ventured among the desperate
river rats, and now he realized that he had succeeded
in the task she had set him. Looking back, he was surprised
at the ease of its accomplishment, but he was
under no illusions regarding the jeopardy he had run.
He had trusted to his aloofness, his place as a newspaper
man, and his frankness, to rescue Carline, and
he had brought him away.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You&#8217;re all righ now,&#8221; Terabon suggested. &#8220;I guess
you&#8217;ve had your lesson.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;A whole book full of them!&#8221; Carline cried. &#8220;I
owe you something&mdash;an apology, and my thanks!
Where are we going?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I was taking you down to a Memphis hospital, or
to Mendova&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need any hospital. I&#8217;m broke; I must get
some money. We&#8217;ll go to Mendova. I know some
people there. I&#8217;ve heard it was a great old town, too!
I always wanted to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon looked at him; Carline had learned nothing.
For a minute remorse and comprehension had flickered
in his mind, now he looked ahead to a good time in
Mendova, to sight-seeing, sporting around, genial
friends, and all the rest. Argument would do no good,
and Terabon retreated from his position as friend and
helper to that of an observer and a recorder of facts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
Whatever pity he might feel, he could not help but
perceive that there was no use trying to help fools.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was just dusk when they ran into Mendova.
The city lights sparkled as they turned in the eddy and
ran up to the shanty-boat town. They dropped an
anchor into the deep water and held the boat off the
bank by the stern while they ran a line up to a six-inch
willow to keep the bow to the bank. The springy, ten-foot
gangplank bridged the gap to the shore.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>More than thirty shanty-boats and gasolene cruisers
were moored along that bank, and from nearly every
one peered sharp eyes, taking a look at the newcomers.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hello, Terabon!&#8221; someone hailed, and the newspaper
man turned, surprised. One never does get over
that feeling of astonishment when, fifteen hundred
miles or so from home, a familiar voice calls one&#8217;s name
in greeting.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; Terabon replied, heartily, and then shook
hands with a market hunter he had met for an hour&#8217;s
gossip in the eddy at St. Louis. &#8220;Any luck, Bill?
How&#8217;s Frank?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Averaging fine,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Frank&#8217;s up
town. Going clear down after all, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Any birds on Yankee Bar?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I saw some geese there&mdash;hunters stopped in, too.
How is the flight?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;We&#8217;re near the tail of it; mostly they&#8217;ve all gone
down. We&#8217;re going to drive for it, and put out our
decoys down around Big Island and below.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll likely see you down there.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sure thing; here&#8217;s Frank.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon shook hands with the two, introduced Carline,
and then the hunters cast off and steered away
down the stream. They had come more than a thousand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
miles with the migrating ducks and geese, intercepting
them at resting or feeding places. That touch
and go impressed Terabon as much as anything he had
ever experienced.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He went up town with Carline, who found a cotton
broker, a timber merchant, and others who knew him.
It was easy to draw a check, have it cashed, and Carline
once more had ready money. Nothing would do but
they must go around to Palura&#8217;s to see Mendova&#8217;s
great attraction for travellers.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Palura supplied entertainment and excitement for
the whole community, and this happened to be one
of his nights of special effort. Personally, Palura was
in a temper. Captain Dalkard, of the Mendova Police,
had been caught between the Citizens&#8217; Committee and
Palura&#8217;s frequenters. There were 100 citizens in the
committee, and Palura&#8217;s frequenters were unnamed,
but familiar enough in local affairs.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The cotton broker thought it was a good joke, and
he explained the whole situation to Terabon and Carline
for their entertainment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Dalkard called in Policeman Laddam and told him
to stand in front of Palura&#8217;s, and tell people to watch
out. You see, there&#8217;s been a lot of complaints about
people being short changed, having their pockets
picked, and getting doped there, and some people think
it doesn&#8217;t do the town any good. Some think we got
to have Palura&#8217;s for the sake of the town&#8217;s business.
I&#8217;m neutral, but I like to watch the fun. We&#8217;ll go
down there and look in to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They had dinner, and about 9 o&#8217;clock they went
around to Palura&#8217;s. It was an old market building
made over into a pleasure resort, and it filled 300 feet
front on Jimpson Street and 160 feet on the flanking
side streets. A bright electric sign covered the front
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
with a flare of yellow lights and there was one entrance,
under the sign.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As Terabon, Carline, and the cotton broker came
along, they saw a tall, broad-shouldered, smooth-shaven
policeman in uniform standing where the lights
showed him up.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Watch your pocketbooks!&#8221; the policeman called softly
to the patrons. &#8220;Watch your change; pickpockets,
short-changers, and card-stackers work the unwary
here! Keep sober&mdash;look out for knock-out drops!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He said it over and over again, in a purring, jeering
tone, and Terabon noticed that he was poised and
tense. In the shadows on both sides of the policeman
Terabon detected figures lurking and he was thrilled
by the evident fact that one brave policeman had been
sent alone into that deadly peril to confront a desperate
gang of crooks, and that the lone policeman gloried
to be there.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The cotton broker, neutral that he was, whispered
as they disregarded the warnings: &#8220;Laddam cleaned
up Front Street in six months; the mob has all come up
here, and this is their last stand. It&#8217;ll hurt business
if they close this joint up, because the town&#8217;ll be dead,
but I wish Palura&#8217;d kind of ease down a bit. He&#8217;s getting
rough.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Little hallways and corridors led into dark recesses
on either side of the building, and faint lights of different
colours showed the way to certain things. Terabon
saw a wonderfully beautiful woman, in furs, with sparkling
diamonds, and of inimitable grace waiting in a little
half-curtained cubby hole; he heard a man ask for
&#8220;Pete,&#8221; and caught the word &#8220;game&#8221; twice. The
sounds were muffled, and a sense of repression and expectancy
permeated the whole establishment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They entered a reception room, with little tables
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
around the sides, music blaring and blatant, a wide
dancing floor, and a scurrying throng. All kinds were
there: spectators who were sight-seeing; participants
who were sporting around; men, women, and scoundrels;
thugs and their prospective victims; people of supposed
allurement; and sports of insipid, silly pose and tricked-up
conspicuousness.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon&#8217;s gaze swept the throng. Noise and merriment
were increasing. Liquor was working on the
patrons. The life of Mendova was stirring to blaring
music. The big hall was bare, rough, and gaunt.
Dusty flags and cobwebs dangled from the rafters and
hog-chain braces. A few hard, white lights cast a
blinding glare straight down on the heads of the dancers
and drinkers and onlookers.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Business was brisk, and shouts of &#8220;Want the waiter!&#8221;
indicated the insistence with which trade was encouraged
and even insisted upon. No sooner had Terabon and
his companions seated themselves than a burly flat-face
with a stained white apron came and inflicted his
determined gaze upon them. He sniffed when Terabon
ordered plain soda.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;We got a man&#8217;s drink.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m on the water wagon for awhile,&#8221; Terabon
smiled, and the waiter nodded, sympathetically. A
tip of a quarter mollified his air of surly expectancy
completely, and as he put the glasses down he said:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;The Boss is sick the way he&#8217;s bein&#8217; treated. They
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to git away wit&#8217; stickin&#8217; a bull in front of his
door like he was a crook.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon heard a woman at a near-by table making
her protest against the policeman out in front. No
other topic was more than mentioned, and the buzz and
burr of voices vied with the sound of the band till it
ended. Then there was a hush.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Palura!&#8221; a whisper rippled in all directions.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon saw a man about 5 feet 10 inches tall, compactly
built, square shouldered, and just a trifle pursy
at the waist line, approaching along the dancing floor.
He was light on his small feet, his shoulders worked with
feline grace, but his face was a face as hard as limestone
and of about the same colour&mdash;bluish gray. His eyes
were the colour of ice, with a greenish tinge. Smooth-shaven
cheeks, close-cropped hair, wing-like ears, and a
little round head were details of a figure that might
have been heroic&mdash;for his jaw was square, his nose
large, and his forehead straight and broad.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Everyone knew he was going out to throw the policeman,
Laddam, into the street. The policeman had
not hurt business a pennyworth as yet, but Palura
felt the insult. Palura knew the consequences of
failing to meet the challenge.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Give &#8217;im hell!&#8221; someone called.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Palura turned and nodded, and a little yelping cheer
went up, which ceased instantly. Terabon, observing
details, saw that Palura&#8217;s coat sagged on the near side&mdash;in
the shape of an automatic pistol. He saw, too, that
the man&#8217;s left sleeve sagged round and hard&mdash;a slingshot
or black-jack.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>There was no delay; Palura went straight through to
his purpose. He disappeared in the dark and narrow
entrance way and not a sound was audible except the
scuffling of feet.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Palura&#8217;s killed four men,&#8221; the cotton broker whispered
to Terabon, under his breath.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>What seemed an age passed. The lights flickered.
Terabon looked about in alarm lest that gang&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A crash outside brought all to their feet, and the
whole crowd fell back against the walls. Out of the
corridor surged a mass of men, and among them stalked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
a stalwart giant of a man draped with the remnants of
a policeman&#8217;s uniform. He had in his right hand a
club which he was swinging about him, and every six
feet a man dropped upon the floor.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon saw Palura writhing, twisting, and working
his way among the fighting mass. He heard a sharp
bark:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Back, boys!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Four or five men stumbled back and two rolled out
of the way of the feet of the policeman. It flashed to
Terabon what had been done. They had succeeded
in getting the policeman into the huge den of vice,
where he could not legally be without a warrant, where
Palura could kill him and escape once more on the
specious plea of self-defence. Terabon saw the grin of
perfect hate on Palura&#8217;s face as both his hands came
up with automatics in them&mdash;a two-handed gunman
with his prey.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>This would teach the policemen of Mendova to mind
their own business! Suddenly Policeman Laddam
threw his night stick backhanded at the infamous
scoundrel, and Palura dodged, but not quite quickly
nor quite far enough. The club whacked noisily
against his right elbow and Palura uttered a cry of
pain as one pistol fell to the floor.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then Laddam snatched out his own automatic, a
45-calibre gun, three pounds or more in weight, and
began to shoot, calmly, deliberately, and with the
artistic appreciation of doing a good job thoroughly.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His first bullet drove Palura straight up, erect; his
next carried the bully back three steps; his next whirled
him around in a sagging spiral, and the fourth dropped
the dive keeper like a bag of loose potatoes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Laddam looked around curiously. He had never
been there before. Lined up on all sides of him were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
the waiters, bouncers, men of prey, their faces ghastly,
and three or four of them sick. The silent throng
around the walls stared at the scene from the partial
shadows; no one seemed even to be breathing. Then
Palura made a horrible gulping sound, and writhed as
he gave up his last gasp of life.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Now then!&#8221; Laddam looked about him, and his
voice was the low roar of a man at his kill. &#8220;You
men pick them up, pack them outside there, and up
to headquarters. March!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As one man, the men who had been Palura&#8217;s marched.
They gathered up the remains of Palura and the men
with broken skulls, and carried them out into the street.
The crowd followed, men and women both. But outside,
the hundreds scurried away in all directions, men
afraid and women choking with horror. Terabon&#8217;s
friend the cotton broker fled with the rest, Carline
disappeared, but Terabon went to headquarters, writing
in his pocket notebook the details of this rare and wonderful
tragedy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Policeman Laddam had single-handed charged and
captured the last citadel of Mendova vice, and the
other policemen, when they looked at him, wore expressions
of wonder and bewilderment. They knew the
Committee of 100 would make him their next chief
and a man under whom it would be a credit to be a
cop.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon, just before dawn, returned toward Mousa
Slough. As he did so, from a dull corner a whisper
greeted him:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Say, Terabon, is it straight, Palura killed up?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Then Mendova&#8217;s sure gone to hell!&#8221; Hilt Despard
the river pirate cried. &#8220;Say, Terabon, there&#8217;s a lady
down by the slough wants to get to talk to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Who&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;She just dropped in to-night, Nelia Crele! She&#8217;s
into her boat down at the head of the sandbar, facing the
switch willows. There&#8217;s a little gasolene sternwheeler
next below her boat.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;She&#8217;s dropped in? All right, boys, much obliged!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They separated.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>But when Terabon searched along the slough for
Nelia&#8217;s boat he did not find it, and to his amazed anger
he found that the gasolene boat in which he had arrived
was also gone, as well as his own skiff and all his outfit.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Darn this river!&#8221; he choked. &#8220;But that&#8217;s a great
story I sent of the killing of Palura!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia Crele had laughed in her heart at
Elijah Rasba as he sat there listening to her
reading. She knew what she was doing to
the mountain parson! She played with his feelings,
touched strings of his heart that had never been touched
before, teased his eyes with a picture of feminine grace,
stirred his mind with the sense of a woman who was
bright and who knew so much that he had never known.
At the same time, there was no malice in it&mdash;just the
delight in making a strong man discover a strength
beyond his own, and in humbling a masculine pride by
the sheer superiority of a woman who had neglected no
opportunity to satisfy a hunger to know.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She knew the power of a single impression and a clear,
quick getaway. She left him dazed by the fortune
which heaped upon him literary classics in a dozen
forms&mdash;fiction, essays, history, poetry, short stories,
criticism, fable, and the like; she laughed at her own
quick liking for the serious-minded, self-deprecatory,
old-young man whose big innocent eyes displayed a soul
enamoured by the spirited intelligence of an experienced
and rather disillusioned young woman who had fled
from him partly because she did know what a sting it
would give him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So with light heart and singing tongue she floated
away on the river, not without a qualm at leaving those
books with Rasba; she loved them too much, but the
sacrifice was so necessary&mdash;for his work! The river
needed him as a missionary. He could help ease the
way of the old sinners, and perhaps by and by he
would reform her, and paint her again with goodness
where she was weather-beaten.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It is easy to go wrong on the Mississippi&mdash;just as
easy, or easier, than elsewhere in the world. The student
of astronomy, gazing into the vast spaces of the
skies, feels his own insignificance increasing, while
the magnitude of the constellations grows upon him.
What can it matter what such a trifling thing, such a
mere atom, as himself does when he is to the worlds of
less size than the smallest of living organisms in a drop
of water?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia Crele looked around as she left the eddy and
saw that her houseboat was but a trifle upon a surface
containing hundreds of square miles. A human being
opposite her on the bank was less in proportion than
a fly on the cabin window pane. Then what could it
matter what she did? Why shouldn&#8217;t she be reckless,
abandoned, and live in the gaiety of ages?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She had read thousands of pages of all kinds with no
guide posts or moral landmarks. A picture of dangerous
delights had come into her imagination. Having
read and understood so much, she had not failed to
discover the inevitable Nemesis on the trail of wrongdoing,
as well as the inevitableness of reward for steadfastness
in virtues&mdash;but she wondered doubtfully what
virtue really was, whether she was not absolved from
many rigid commandments by the failure of the world
to keep faith with her and reward her for her own
patience and atone for her own sufferings.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was easy, only too easy, on the surface to feel
that if she wanted to be gay and wanton, living for
the hour, it was no one&#8217;s affair but her own. She
fought the question out in her mind. She fixed her
determination on the young and, in one sense, inexperienced
newspaper man whose ambitions pleased
her fancy and whose innocence delighted her own mood.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He was down the river somewhere, and when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
landed in at Mendova in the late twilight she saw his
skiff swinging from the stern of a motorboat. Having
made fast near it, she quickly learned that he had gone
up town, and that someone had heard him say that he
was going to Palura&#8217;s.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Palura&#8217;s! Nelia had heard the fascination of that
den&#8217;s ill-fame. She laughed to herself when she thought
that Terabon would excuse his going there on the
ground of its being right in his line of work, that he
must see that place because otherwise he would not
know how to describe it.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;If I can catch him there!&#8221; she thought to herself.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She went to Palura&#8217;s, and Old Mississippi seemed
to favour her. She found another woman who knew
the ropes there and who was glad to help her play the
game. From a distance Nelia Crele discovered that
Terabon was with Carline, her own husband. She
dismissed him with a shrug of her shoulders, and told
her companion to take care of him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia, having plagued the soul of the River Prophet,
Rasba, now with equal zest turned to seize Terabon,
careless of where the game ended if only she could begin
it and carry it on to her own music and in her own
measure.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They had it all determined: Carline was to be wedged
away with his friend, a cotton broker that Daisy&mdash;Nelia&#8217;s
newfound accomplice&mdash;knew, and Terabon
was to be tempted to &#8220;do the Palace,&#8221; and he was to be
caught unaware, by Nelia, who wanted to dance with
him, dine with him under bright lights, and drink dangerous
drinks with him. She knew him sober and industrious,
good and faithful, a decent, reputable working
man&mdash;she wanted to see him waked up and boisterous,
careless for her sake and because of her desires.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She just felt wicked, wanted to be wicked, and didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
care how wicked she might be. She counted, however,
without the bonds which the Mississippi River seems at
times to cast around its favourites&mdash;the Spirit of the
river which looks after his own.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She had not even seen Policeman Laddam standing
at the main entrance of the notorious resort, for Daisy
had taken her through another door. She went to
the exclusive &#8220;Third,&#8221; and from there emerged onto
the dancing floor just as Palura ostentatiously went
forth to drive Laddam away, or to kill him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Daisy checked her, for the minute or two of suspense,
and then the whole scene, the tragedy, was enacted
before her gaze. She was not frightened; she was not
even excited; the thing was so astonishing that she did
not quite grasp its full import till she saw Palura
stumbling back, shot again and again. Daisy caught
her arm and clutched it in dumb panic, and when the
policeman calmly bent the cohorts of the dead man
to his will and carried away his victims, Daisy dragged
Nelia away.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then Daisy disappeared and Nelia was left to her
own devices.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She was vexed and disappointed. She knew nothing
of the war in Mendova. Politics had never engaged her
attention, and the significance of the artistic killing
of Palura did not appear to her mind. She was simply
possessed by an indignant feminine impatience to think
that Terabon had escaped, and she was angry when she
had only that glimpse of him, as with his notebook in
hand he raced his pencil across the blank pages, jotting
down the details and the hasty, essential impressions
as he caught them.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She heard the exodus. She heard women sobbing
and men gasping as they swore and fled. She gathered
up her own cloak and left with reluctant footsteps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She realized that she had arrived there just one day
too late to &#8220;do&#8221; Palura&#8217;s. The fugitives, as they scurried
by, reminded her of some description which she
had read of the Sack of Rome; or was it the Fall of
Babylon? Their sins were being visited upon the
wicked, and Nelia Crele, since she had not sinned, could
not thrill with quite the same terror and despair of the
wretches who had sinned in spite of their consciences,
instead of through ignorance or wantonness. She took
her departure not quite able to understand why there
had been so much furore because one man had been
killed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She was among the last to leave the accursed place,
and she saw the flight of the ones who had delayed,
perhaps to loot, perhaps having just awakened to the
fact of the tragedy. She turned toward Mousa Slough,
and her little shanty-boat seemed very cool and bare
that late evening. The bookshelves were all empty,
and she was just a little too tired to sleep, just a little
too stung by reaction to be happy, and rather too
much out of temper to be able to think straight and
clearly on the disappointment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Mendova had been familiar in her ears since childhood;
she had heard stories of its wildness, its gayeties,
its recklessness. Impression had been made upon impression,
so that when she had found herself nearing
the place of her dreams, she was in the mood to enter
into its wildest and gayest activities; she had expected
to, and she had known in her own mind that when she
met Terabon she would be irresistible.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>At last she shuddered. She seemed to hear a voice,
the river&#8217;s voice, declare that this thing had happened
to prevent her seeking to betray herself and Terabon,
not to mention that other matter which did not affect
her thought in the least, her husband&#8217;s honour.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The idea of her husband&#8217;s honour made the thing
absurd to her. There was no such thing as that honour.
She had plotted to get Carline out of the way
now that she heard he was clear of the pirates. On second
thought, she was sorry that she had been so hasty
in returning to the boat, wishing that she had followed
up Terabon.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She walked out onto the bow deck, and standing in
the dark, with her door closed, looked up and down the
slough. A dozen boats were in sight. She heard a
number of men and women talking in near-by boats,
and the few words she heard indicated that the river
people had a pretty morsel of gossip in the killing of
Palura.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She heard men rustling through the weeds and switch
willows of the boatmen&#8217;s pathway, and she hailed; she
was now a true river woman, though she did not know it.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Say, boys, do you know if Terabon and Carline
landed here to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;We just landed in,&#8221; one answered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Going up town?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I want to know about them&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Late this evening; I was up to Palura&#8217;s when&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She laughed aloud, as she added, &#8220;I was there when
Palura was killed by the policeman.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Palura killed a policeman!&#8221; Despard said. &#8220;He&#8217;s

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;No, Palura was killed by a policeman. Shot him
dead right on the dance-hall floor.&#8221;

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The pirates choked. The thing was unbelievable.
They came down to the boat and she described the
affair briefly, and they demanded details.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They felt that it would vitally affect Mendova.
They whispered among themselves as to what it meant.
They learned that a policeman had been stationed in
front of the notorious resort and that that policeman
had done the shooting during a fight with waiters and
bouncers and with Palura himself.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t better get to go up town,&#8221; Jet whimpered.
&#8220;Hit don&#8217;t sound right!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They argued and debated, and finally went on their
way, having promised Nelia that they would see and
tell Terabon, on the quiet, that she had come into the
slough, and that she wanted to see him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She waited for some time, hoping that Terabon
would come, but finally went to sleep. She was tired,
and excitement had deserted her. She slept more
soundly than in some time.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Once she partly awakened, and thought that some
drift log had bumped into her boat; then she felt a
gentle undulation, as of the waves of a passing steamer,
but she was too sleepy to contemplate that phenomenon
in a rather narrow water channel around a bend from
the main current.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was not till she had slept long and well that she
began to dream vividly. She was impatient with
dreams; they were always full of disappointment.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Daylight came, and sunshine penetrated the window
under which she slept. The bright rays fell upon her
closed eyes and stung her cheeks. She awakened with
difficulty, and looked around wonderingly. She saw
the sunlight move along the wall and then drift back
again. She felt the boat teetering and swaggering.
She looked out of the window and saw a distant wood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
across the familiar, glassy yellow surface of the Mississippi.
With a low whisper of dismay she started out to
look around, and found that she was really adrift in
mid-river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>On the opposite side of the boat she saw the blank
side of a boat against her cabin window. As she stood
there, she heard or felt a motion on the boat alongside.
Someone stepped, or rather jumped heavily, onto the
bow deck of her boat and flung the cabin door open.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She sprang to get her pistol, and stood ready, as the
figure of a man stumbled drunkenly into her presence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Parson Elijah Rasba, the River Prophet,
could not think what he would say to these
river people who had determined to have a
sermon for their Sabbath entertainment. Neither his
Bible nor his hurried glances from book to book which
Nelia Crele had given him brought any suggestion
which seemed feasible. His father had always declared
that a sermon, to be effective, &#8220;must have one bullet
fired straight.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>What bullet would reach the souls of these river people
who sang ribald songs, danced to lively music, and
lived clear of all laws except the one they called &#8220;The
Law,&#8221; a deadly, large-calibre revolver or automatic
pistol?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I &#8217;low I just got to talk to them like folks,&#8221; he decided
at last, and with that comforting decision went
to sleep.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The first thing, after dawn, when he looked out upon
the river in all the glory of sunshine and soft atmosphere
and young birds, he heard a hail:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Eh, Prophet! What time yo&#8217; all goin&#8217; to hold the
meeting?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Round 10 or 11 o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba went to one of the boats for breakfast, and
he was surprised when Mamie Caope asked him to invoke
a blessing on their humble meal of hot-bread,
sorghum, fried pork chops, oatmeal, fried spuds, percolator
coffee, condensed cream, nine-inch perch caught
that morning, and some odds and ends of what she called
&#8220;leavings.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then the women all went over on his big mission boat
and cleaned things up, declaring that men folks didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
know how to keep their own faces clean, let alone houseboats.
They scrubbed and mopped and re-arranged,
and every time Rasba appeared they splashed so much
that he was obliged to escape.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When at last he was allowed to return he found the
boat all cleaned up like a honey-comb. He found that
the gambling apparatus had been taken away, except
the heavy crap table, which was made over into a pulpit,
and that chairs and benches had been arranged
into seats for a congregation. A store-boat man
climbed to the boat&#8217;s roof at 10:30, with a Texas steer&#8217;s
horn nearly three feet long, and began to blow.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The blast reverberated across the river, and echoed
back from the shore opposite; it rolled through the
woods and along the sandbars; and the Prophet, listening,
recalled the tales of trumpets which he had read
in the Bible. At intervals of ten minutes old Jodun
filled his great lungs, pursed his lips, and swelled his
cheeks to wind his great horn, and the summons carried
for miles. People appeared up the bank, swamp angels
from the timber brakes who strolled over to see what
the river people were up to, and skiffs sculled over to
bring them to the river meeting. The long bend opposite,
and up and down stream, where no sign of life
had been, suddenly disgorged skiffs and little motorboats
of people whose floating homes were hidden in
tiny bays, or covered by neutral colours against their
backgrounds.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The women hid Rasba away, like a bridegroom, to
wait the moment of his appearance, and when at last
he was permitted to walk out into the pulpit he nearly
broke down with emotion. There were more than a
hundred men and women, with a few children, waiting
eagerly for him. He was a good old fellow; he meant
all right; he&#8217;d taken care of Jest Prebol, who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
deserved to be shot; he was pretty ignorant of river ways,
but he wanted to learn about them; he hadn&#8217;t hurt their
feelings, for he minded his own business, saying not
a word about their good times, even if he wouldn&#8217;t
dance himself. They could do no better than let him
know that they hadn&#8217;t any hard feelings against him,
even if he was a parson, for he didn&#8217;t let on that they
were sinners. Anyway, they wanted to hear him hit
it up!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I came down here to find a son whose mother was
worrited about him,&#8221; Rasba began at the beginning.
&#8220;I &#8217;lowed likely if I could find Jock it&#8217;d please his
mammy, an&#8217; perhaps make her a little happier. And
Jock &#8217;lowed he&#8217;d better go back, and stand trial, even
if it was a hanging matter.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You see, I didn&#8217;t expect you&#8217;d get to learn very
much from me, and I haven&#8217;t been disappointed. I&#8217;m
the one that&#8217;s learning, and when I think what you&#8217;ve
done for me, and when I see what Old Mississip&#8217; does,
friendlying for all of us, tripping us along&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They understood. He looked at the boat, at them,
and through the wide-open windows at the sun-rippled
water.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Now for religion. Seems like I&#8217;m impudent, telling
you kindly souls about being good to one another,
having no hard, mean feelings against anybody, and
living like you ought to live. We&#8217;re all sinners! Time
and again hit&#8217;s ag&#8217;in the grain to do what&#8217;s right, and if
we taste a taste of white liquor, or if hit&#8217;s stained with
burnt sugar to make hit red, why&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; someone grinned. &#8220;Parson Rasba knows!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The preacher joined the laughter.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh!&#8221; he admitted, more gravely, &#8220;I know.
I &#8217;lowed, one time, that I&#8217;d git to know this yeah happiness
that comes of liquor, an&#8217; I shore took one awful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
gulp. Three nights an&#8217; three days I neveh slept a
wink, an&#8217; me settin&#8217; theh by the fireplace, waitin&#8217;
to be lit up an&#8217; jubulutin&#8217;, but hit didn&#8217;t come. I&#8217;ve
be&#8217;n happier, jes&#8217; a-settin&#8217; an&#8217; lookin&#8217; at that old riveh,
hearin&#8217; the wild geese flocking by!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;That old riveh&mdash;Lawse! If the Mississippi brings
you fish and game; if it gives you sheltered eddies to
anchor in, and good banks or sandbars to tie against;
if this great river out here does all that for you, what
do you reckon the Father of that river, of all the world,
of all the skies would do, He being so much friendlier
and powerfuller?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s easy to forget the good that&#8217;s done to you.
Lots an&#8217; lots of times, I bet you&#8217;ve not even thought of
the good you&#8217;ve had from the river, from the sunshine,
from the winds, plenty to eat and warm of nights on
your boats and in your cabins. It&#8217;s easy to remember
the little evil things, the punishments that are visited
upon us for our sins or because we&#8217;re ignorant and don&#8217;t
know; but reckon up the happiness you have, the
times you are blessed with riches of comfort and pleasure,
and you&#8217;ll find yourself so much happier than
you are sad that you&#8217;ll know how well you are cared
for.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I cayn&#8217;t preach no reg&#8217;lar sermon, with text-tes
and singing and all that. Seems like I jes&#8217; want to talk
along rambling like, and tell you how happy you are all,
for I don&#8217;t reckon you&#8217;re much wickeder than you are
friendly on the average. I keep a-hearing about murdering
and stealing and whiskey boating and such
things. They&#8217;re signs of the world&#8217;s sinfulness. We
talk a heap about such things; they&#8217;re real, of course,
and we cayn&#8217;t escape them. At the same time, look
at me!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I came down here, sorry with myse&#8217;f, and you make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
me glad, not asking if I&#8217;d done meanness or if I&#8217;d betrayed
my friends. You &#8217;lowed I was jes&#8217; a man,
same&#8217;s you. I couldn&#8217;t tell you how to be good, because
I wasn&#8217;t no great shakes myse&#8217;f, and the worse I was
the better you got. Buck an&#8217; Jock gives me this boat
for a mission boat; I&#8217;m ignorant, an&#8217; a woman gives
me&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He choked up. What the woman had given him was
too immeasurable and too wonderful for mere words
to express his gratitude.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m just one of those shoutin&#8217;, ignorant mountain
parsons. I could out-whoop most of them up yonder.
But down yeah, Old Mississip&#8217; don&#8217;t let a man shout
out. When yo&#8217; play dance music, hit&#8217;s softer and
sweeter than some of those awful mountain hymns in
which we condemn lost souls to the fire. Course, the
wicked goes to hell, but somehow I cayn&#8217;t git up much
enthusiasm about that down yeah. What makes my
heart rejoice is that there&#8217;s so much goodness around
that I bet &#8217;most anybody&#8217;s got a right smart chanct to
get shut of slippin&#8217; down the claybanks into hell.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Jest Prebol?&#8221; someone asked, seeing Prebol&#8217;s face
in the window of the little red shanty-boat moored
close by, where he, too, could listen.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Jest Prebol&#8217;s been my guide down the riveh,&#8221;
the Prophet retorted. &#8220;I can say that I only wish I
could be as good a pilot for poor souls and sinners
toward heaven as Jest is a river pilot for a wandering
old mountain parson on the Mississippi&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hi-i-i!&#8221; a score of voices laughed, and someone
shouted, &#8220;So row me down the Jordan!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They all knew the old religious song which fitted so
nicely into the conditions on the Mississippi. Somebody
called to someone else, and the musicians in the
congregation slipped away to return with their violins,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
banjos, accordions, guitars, and other familiar instruments.
Before the preacher knew it, he had more
music in the church than he had ever heard in a church
before&mdash;and they knew what to play and what to sing.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The sermon became a jubilee, and he would talk along
awhile till something he said struck a tuneful suggestion,
and the singing would begin again; and when at
last he brought the service to an end, he was astonished
to find that he had preached and they had sung for
more than two hours.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then there was scurrying about, and from all sides
the calm airs of the sunny Sabbath were permeated
with the odours of roasts and fried things, coffee and
sauces. A score wanted Rasba to dine out, but Mrs.
Caope claimed first and personal acquaintance, and
her claim was acknowledged. The people from far
boats and tents returned to their own homes. Two or
three boats of the fleet, in a hurry to make some place
down stream, dropped out in mid-afternoon, and the
little shanty-boat town was already breaking up, having
lasted but a day, but one which would long be remembered
and talked about. It was more interesting
than murder, for murders were common, and the circumstances
and place were so remarkable that even a
burning steamboat would have had less attention and
discussion.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The following morning Mrs. Caope offered Rasba
$55 for his old poplar boat, and he accepted it gladly.
She said she had a speculation in mind, and before
nightfall she had sold it for $75 to two men who were
going pearling up the St. Francis, and who thought that
a boat a parson had tripped down in would bring them
good luck.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The dancers of Saturday night, the congregation of
Sunday, on Monday afternoon were scattered. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Caope&#8217;s and another boat dropped off the river to visit
friends, and mid-afternoon found Parson Rasba and
Prebol alone again, drawing down toward Mendova.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Prebol knew that town, and he told Rasba about it.
He promised that they would see something of it, but
they could not make it that evening, so they landed in
Sandbar Reach for the night. Just after dawn, while
the rising sun was flashing through the tree tops from
east to west, a motorboat driving up stream hailed as it
passed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Ai-i-i, Prebol! Palura&#8217;s killed up!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Prebol shouted out for details, and the passer-by,
slowing down, gave a few more:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Had trouble with the police, an&#8217; they shot him daid
into his own dance floor&mdash;and Mendova&#8217;s no good no
more!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Now what the boys goin&#8217; to do when they make a
haul?&#8221; Prebol demanded in great disgust of Parson
Rasba. &#8220;Fust the planters shot up whiskey boats;
then the towns went dry, an&#8217; now they closed up Palura&#8217;s
an&#8217; shot him daid. Wouldn&#8217;t hit make yo&#8217; sick,
Parson! They ain&#8217;t no fun left nowheres for good
sports.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba could not make any comment. He was far
from sure of his understanding. He felt as though his
own life had been sheltered, remote from these wild
doings of murders and shanty-boat-fleet dances and a
congregation assembling in a gambling boat handed to
him for a mission! He could not quite get his bearings,
but the books blessed him with their viewpoints, as
numerous as the points of the compass. He could not
turn a page or a chapter without finding something
that gave him a different outlook or a novel idea.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They landed in late on Monday at Mendova bar,
just above the wharf. Up the slough were many shanty-boats,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
and gaunt dogs and floppy buzzards fed along the
bar and down the wharf.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Groups of men and women were scattered along both
the slough and the river banks, talking earnestly and
seriously. Rasba, bound up town to buy supplies,
heard the name of Palura on many lips; the policemen
on their beats waltzed their heavy sticks about in debonair
skilfulness; and stooped, rat-like men passing by,
touched their hats nervously to the august bluecoats.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When Rasba returned to the boat, he found a man
waiting for him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;My name is Lester Terabon,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;I
landed in Saturday, and went up town. When I
returned, my skiff and outfit were all gone&mdash;somebody
stole them.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; Rasba exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of you.
You write for newspapers?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir, and I&#8217;m some chump, being caught that
way.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;They meant to rob you?&#8221; Rasba asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, of&#8211;&#8211;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; Terabon saw a new outlook
on the question.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Did they go down?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, sir, I heard so. I don&#8217;t care about my boat,
typewriter, and duffle; what bothers me is my notebooks.
Months of work are in them. If I could get them
back!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I&#8217;m going down stream; it&#8217;s down
below, somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I need someone to help me,&#8221; Rasba said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
a wounded man here who has a doctor with him. If he
goes up to the hospital or stays with us, I&#8217;ll be glad to
have you for your help and company.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;m in luck.&#8221; Terabon laughed with relief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Just that way the Mississippi River&#8217;s narrow channel
brought the River Prophet and the river reporter together.
Terabon went up town and bought some
clothes, some writing paper, a big blank notebook, and
a bottle of fountain-pen ink. With that outfit he returned
on board, and a delivery car brought down his
share of things to eat.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The doctor said Prebol ought to go into the hospital
for at least a week, and Terabon found Prebol&#8217;s pirate
friends, hidden up the slough on their boat, not venturing
to go out except at night. They took the little
red shanty-boat up the slough, and Prebol went to the
hospital.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba, frankly curious about the man who wrote for
newspapers for a living, listened to accounts of an odd
and entertaining occupation. He asked about the
Palura shooting which everyone was talking about,
and when Terabon described it as he had witnessed it,
Rasba shook his head.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Now they&#8217;ll close up that big market of sin?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;They&#8217;ve all scattered around.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yes, and they scattered with my skiff, too, and
probably robbed Carline of his boat&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Carline! You know him?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I came down with him from Yankee Bar, and we
went up to Palura&#8217;s together. I lost him in the shuffle,
when the big cop killed Palura.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;And Mrs. Carline, Nelia Crele?&#8221; Rasba demanded.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why&mdash;I&mdash;they said she&#8217;d landed in. She&#8217;s gone,
too&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;You know her?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;So do I. Those books,&#8221; he waved his hand toward
the loaded shelves, &#8220;she gave them all to me for my
mission boat!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon stared. He went to the shelves and looked
at the volumes. In each one he found the little bookmark
which she had used in cataloguing them:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; text-align:center'>Nelia Carline,<br />
A Loved Book.<br />
No. 87<br /></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A jealous pang seized him, in spite of his reportorial
knowledge that jealousy is vanity for a literary person.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I &#8217;low we mout &#8217;s well drop out,&#8221; Rasba suggested.
&#8220;Missy Crele&#8217;s down below some&#8217;rs. Her boat
floated out to&#8217;d mornin&#8217;, one of the boys said.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Carline had discovered his wife in the excitement
at Palura&#8217;s, and with the cunning of a
drunken man had shadowed her. He followed
her down to Mousa Bayou, and saw her go on board her
cabin-boat. He watched, with more cunning, to see
for whom she was waiting. He had in his pocket a
heavy automatic pistol with which to do murder.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had seen killing done, and the thing was fascinating;
some consciousness that the policeman had done

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Disappointment lingered in his mind when the lights
went out on board Nelia&#8217;s boat, and for a long time he
meditated as to what he should do. He saw skiffs,
motorboats, shanty-boats pulling hastily down the
slough into the Mississippi. It was the Exodus of Sin.
Mendova&#8217;s rectitude had asserted its strength and
power, and now the exits of the city were flickering
with the shadows of departing hordes of the night and
of the dark, all of whom had two fears: one of daylight,
the other of sudden death.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Their departure before his eyes, with darkened boats,
gave Carline an idea at last. He wanted to get away
off somewhere, where he could be alone, without any
interruption. Bitter anger surged in his breast because
his wife had shamed him, left him, led him this any-thing-but-merry
chase down the Mississippi. A proud
Carline had no call to be treated thataway by any woman,
especially by the daughter of an old ne&#8217;er-do-well
whom he had condescended to marry.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had always been a hunter and outdoor man, and
it was no particular trick for him to cast off the lines of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
Nelia&#8217;s boat and push it out into the sluggish current,
and it was as easy for him to take his own boat and drop
down into the river. He brought the two boats quietly
together and lashed them fast with rope fenders to
prevent rubbing and bumping&mdash;did it with surprising
skill.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The Mississippi carried them down the reach into
the crossing, and around a bend out of sight of even the
glow of the Mendova lights. Here was one of those
lonesome stretches of the winding Mississippi, with
wooded bank, sandbar, sky-high and river-deep loneliness.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Carline, with alcoholic persistency, held to his
scheme. He drank the liquor which he had salvaged
in the riotous night. He thought he knew how to
bring people to time, especially women. He had seen
a big policeman set the pace, and the sound of the club
breaking skull bones was still a shock in his brain, oft
repeated.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The sudden dawn caught him by surprise, and he
stared rather nonplussed by the sunrise, but when he
looked around and saw that he was in mid-stream and
miles from anywhere and from any one, he knew that
there was no better place in the world for taming one&#8217;s
wife, and extorting from her the apologies which seemed
to Carline appropriate, all things considered, for the
occasion.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The time had arrived for action. He rose with dignity
and buttoned up his waistcoat; he pulled down
his coat and gave his cravat a hitch; he rubbed a tentative
hand on the lump where the pirates had bumped
him; he scrambled over the side onto the cabin-boat
deck, and entered upon the scene of his conquest.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He found himself confronted by Nelia in a white-faced,
low-voiced fury instead of in the mood he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
expected. She wasn&#8217;t sorry; she wasn&#8217;t apologetic; she
wasn&#8217;t even amiable or conciliatory.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Gus Carline! Drunk, as usual. What do you
mean by this?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;S&#8217;all right!&#8221; he assured her, flapping his hands.
&#8220;Y&#8217;re m&#8217;wife; I&#8217;m your husban&#8217;! S&#8217;all right!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She drew her pistol and fired a bullet past him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Go!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Before he knew what had happened he had backed
out upon the bow deck, and she bundled him up onto
his own craft. She cast off the bow line and ran to the
stern to cast off the line there. As she did so, she discovered
Terabon&#8217;s skiff around at the far side where
Carline could not see it.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Her husband was still shaking his fist in her direction,
but the two boats were well apart as she rowed
away with her sweeps. He stood there, undecided.
He had not expected the sudden and effective resistance.
Before he knew it, she was lost in a whole fleet of little
houseboats which were, to his eyes, both in the sky,
underwater, and scattered all over the tip-tilting surfaces.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The current, under the impulse of her rowing, carried
Nelia into an eddy and she saw the cruiser rocking
down a crossing into the mirage of the distance. She
sat on the bow deck while her boat made a long swing
in the eddy. Things did not happen down the river
as she planned or expected. She regarded the previous
night&#8217;s entertainment with less indifference now; something
about the calm of that broad river affected her.
She realized that watching the killing of Palura had
given her a shock so deep that now she was trembling
with the weakness of horror.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She had seen Gus Carline stumble into her cabin,
and with angry defiance she had acted with the intention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
of doing to him what she had done to Prebol&mdash;but
she had missed deliberately when she shot. When she
recalled the matter, she saw that for weeks she had
been living in a false frame of mind; that she was
desperate, and not contented; that she was afraid&mdash;and
that she hated fear.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Her pistol was sign of her bravado, and her shots
were the indication of her desperation. The memory
of the wan face of Prebol brought down by her bullet
was now an accusation, not a pride.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Old Mississip&#8217; had received her gently in her most
furious mood, but now that immense, active calm of
vast power was working on the untamed soul which she
owned. The river swept along, and its majesty no
longer gave her the feeling that nothing mattered. Far
from it! Though she rebelled against the idea, her
mind knew that she was in rebellion, that she was going
against the current. And the river&#8217;s mood was dangerous,
now, to the wanton feelings to which she had
desperately yielded but unsuccessfully.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The old, familiar, sharp division between right
and wrong was presented to her gaze as if the river itself
were calling her attention to it. She could not
escape the necessity of a choice, with evil so persuasive
and delightful and virtue so depressing and necessary.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She investigated Terabon&#8217;s outfit with curiosity and
questioning. His typewriter, his maps, his few books,
his stack of notes neatly compiled in loose-leaf files,
were the materials which caught and held her fancy.
She took them on board her shanty-boat and read the
record which he had made, from day to day, from his
inspection of Commission records at St. Louis to the
purchase of his boat in shanty-boat town, and his departure
down the river.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His words were intimate and revealing:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:0.0em; '>Oct. 5; In mid-stream among a lot of islands; rafts of ducks; a
dull, blue day, still those great limestone hills, with hollows through
which the wind comes when opposite&mdash;coolies?&#8211;&#8211;; in the far distance
a rowboat. On the Missouri side, the hills; on the other the
flats, with landing sheds. Ducks in great flocks&mdash;look like sea serpents
when flying close to the water; like islands on it&mdash;wary birds.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>That was above the part of the river which she
knew; she turned to Kaskaskia, and read facts familiar
to her:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:0.0em; '>I met Crele, an old hunter-trapper, in a slough below St. Genevieve.
He was talkative, and said he had the prettiest girl on a
hundred miles of river. She had married a man of the name of Carline,
real rich and a big bug. &#8220;But my gal&#8217;s got the looks, yes,
indeed!&#8221; If I find her, I must be sure and tell her to write to her
folks&mdash;river romance!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia&#8217;s face warmed as she read those phrases as
well it might. She wondered what other things he
had written in his book of notes, and her eye caught
a page:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:0.0em; '>House boatmen are a bad lot. Once a young man came to work
for a farmer back on the hills. He&#8217;d been there a month, when one
night he disappeared; a set of double harness went with him. Another
man hung around a week, and raided a grocery store, filling
washtubs with groceries, cloth, and shoes&mdash;went away in a skiff.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She turned to where he travelled down the Mississippi
with her husband and read the description of Gus Carline&#8217;s
whiskey skiff man, his purchase of a gallon of
whiskey; the result, which her imagination needed but
few words to visualize; then Terabon&#8217;s drifting away
down stream, leaving the sot to his own insensibilities.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Breathlessly she read his snatching sentences from
bend to shoal, from reach to reach, until he described
her red-hull, white cabin-boat, described the &#8220;young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
river woman&#8221; who occupied it; and then, page after
page of memoranda, telling almost her own words, and
his own words, as he had remembered them. What he
wrote here had not been intended for her eyes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:0.0em; '>She&#8217;s dropping down this river all alone; pirates nor scoundrels
nor river storms nor jeopardies seem to disturb her in the least.
She even welcomes me, as an interesting sort of intellectual specimen,
who can talk about books and birds and a multitude of things.
She may well rest assured that none of us river rats have any designs,
whatever, on a lady who shoots quick, shoots straight, and dropped
Prebol at thirty yards off-hand with an automatic!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She read the paragraph with interest and then with
care; she did not know whether to be pleased or not
by that brutally frank statement that he was afraid of
her&mdash;suppose he hadn&#8217;t been afraid? Then, of what
was he really afraid&mdash;not of her pistol! She read on
through the pages of notes. The description of the
walk with her up the sandbar and back, there at Island
No. 10, thrilled her, for it told the apparently trifling
details&mdash;the different kinds of sands, the sounds, the
night gloom, the quick sense of the river presence, the
glow of distant New Madrid. He had lived it, and he
wrote it in terms that she realized were the words she
might have used to describe her own observations and
sensations.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She searched through his notes in vain for any suggestion
of the emotions which she had felt. She
shrugged her shoulders, because he had not written
anything to indicate that he had discovered her allurement.
He had written in bald words the fact of her
sending him on the errand of rescue, to save her husband&mdash;and
she was obliged to digest in her mind the
bare but significant phrase:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>And, because she has sent me, I am glad to go!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>His notes made her understand him better, but they
did not reveal all his own feelings. He wrote her down
as an object of curiosity, as he spoke of the sour face
and similitude of good humour in the whiskey boater&#8217;s
expression. In the same painstaking way he described
her own friendliness for a passing skiff boater. The
impersonality of his remarks about himself surprised
while it perplexed her.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The mass of material which he had gathered for
making articles and stories amazed her. The stack
of pages, closely typewritten, was more than two inches
thick. A few pages disclosed consecutive paragraphs
with subjects, predicates, and complete sense, but
other pages showed only disjointed phrases, words, and
flashes of ideas.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The changing notes, the questioning, the observations,
the minute recording were fascinating to her.
It revealed a phase of writers&#8217; lives of which she had
known nothing&mdash;the gathering of myriads of details,
in order to free the mind for accurate rendering of
pictures and conditions. She wished she could see
some of the finished product of Terabon&#8217;s use of these
notes, and the wish revealed a chasm, an abyss that
confronted her. She felt deserted, as though she had
need of Terabon to give her a view of his own life, that
she might be diverted into something not sordid, and decidedly
not according to Augustus Carline&#8217;s ideals!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>After a time, seeing that Carline&#8217;s boat had disappeared
down river, she threw over her anchor, and rested
in the eddy. It was on the west side, with a chute
entrance through a sandbar and willow-grown island
points opposite. She brought out her map book to see
if she could learn where she was anchored, but the
printed map, with the bright red lines of recent surveys,
helped her not at all. She turned from sheet to sheet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
down to Memphis, without finding what she wanted to
know.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She saw some shanty-boats down the river; she saw
some up the river; but there was none near her till
just before dark a motor skiff came down in the day&#8217;s
gray gloom, and passed within a few yards of her.
When she looked at the two men in the boats she learned
to know what fear is&mdash;river terror&mdash;horror of mankind
in its last extremities of depravity and heartlessness.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She saw men stooped and slinking, whose glance
was sidelong and whose expression was venomous,
casting covert looks toward her as they passed by into
the gray mist of falling night. They entered a narrow
waterway among the sandbars, and left behind the
feeling that along that waterway was the abiding place
of lost souls. She wanted to take up the anchor and
flee out onto the river, but when she looked into the
darkening breadths, she felt the menace of the miles,
of the mists, of the wooded shores. Foreboding was
in her tired soul.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She examined her pistol, to make sure that it was
ready to use; she locked the stern door, and drew the
curtains; she went to the bow and looked carefully
at the anchor-line fastenings. With no light on board
to blind her gaze, she scrutinized all the surroundings,
to make sure of her locality. In that blank gloom she
was dubious but brave. Not a thing visible, not a
sound audible, nothing but her remote and little understood
sensation of premonitory dread explained her
perturbation. She entered the cabin, locked the door,
set the window catches and sticks, lighted the lamp,
and sat down to&mdash;think. Her bookshelves were
empty, and she was glad that she had emptied them
in a good cause. It occurred to her that she ought to
make up another list for her own service, and with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
pencil and paper she began that most fascinating work,
the compilation of one&#8217;s own library. As she made her
selections, she forgot the menace which she had observed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In the stillness she thought her own ears were ringing
and paid no attention to the humming that increased in
volume moment by moment. It was a flash of lightning
without thunder that stirred her senses. She
looked up from her absorption.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She heard a distant rumble, a near-by stirring. The
wavelets along the side of the boat were noisy; they
rattled like paper. Something fell clattering on the
roof of the cabin, and a tearing, ripping, crashing struck
the boat and fairly tossed it skipping along the surface
of the water. The lamp blew out as a window pane
broke, and the woman was thrown to the floor in a
confusion of chairs, table, and other loose objects.
Happily, the stove was screwed fast to the floor. The
anchor line broke with a loud twang, and the black
confusion was lighted with flares and flashes of gray-blue
glaring.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The river had made Nelia Crele believe that she was
in jeopardy from man; but it was a little hurricane, or,
as the river people call them, cyclones, that menaced.
Dire as was the confusion and imminent as was the
peril, Nelia felt a sense of relief from what would have
been harder to bear&mdash;an attack by men. She had
searched the map for information, but it was the river
which inspired her to understand that the hurricane
was her deliverance rather than her assailant.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She did not know whether she would live or die
during those seconds when the gale crashed like maul
blows and wind and rain poured and whistled in at the
broken window pane. She laughed at her predicament,
tumbling in dishevelment around the bouncing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
cabin floor, and when the suck and send of the storm
crater passed by, leaving a driving wind, she stepped
out on the bows, and caught up her sweeps to ride the
waves and face the gale that set steadily in from the
north.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was gray, impenetrable black&mdash;that night. She
could see nothing, neither the waves nor the sky nor the
river banks; but singing aloud, she steadied the boat,
bow to the wind, holding it to the gale by dipping the
sweeps deep and strong.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Beaten steadily back, unable to know how far or
in what direction, she found her soul, serenely above the
mere physical danger, loving that vast torrent more
than ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Parson Rasba and Terabon floated out into
the main river current and ran with the stream.
They were passing through the famous, changeable
channels among the great sandbars from Island
No. 34 down to Hopefield Bend. They rounded Dean
Island Bend in the darkness, for they had floated all
day and far into the night, driven by an anxiety which
was inexplicable.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They wanted to be going; they felt an urge which
they commented upon; it was a voice in their hearts,
and not audible in their ears. Yet when they stood
nervously at the great sweeps of the mission boat, to
pull the occasional strokes necessary to clear a bar or
flank a bend, they could almost declare that the river
was talking.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They strained their ears in vain, trying to distinguish
the meanings of the distant murmurings. Terabon,
now well familiar with the river, could easily believe
that he was listening to the River Spirit, and his feelings
were melancholy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For months he had strained every power of his mind
to record the exact facts about the Mississippi, and he
put down tens of thousands of words describing and
stating what he saw, heard, and knew. With one
stroke he had been separated from his work, and he
feared that he had lost his precious notes for all time.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Either Carline or river pirates had carried them
away. He hoped, he believed, that he would find them,

when he recalled with what frankness he
had put down details, names, acts, rumours, reports&mdash;all
the countless things which go to make up the &#8220;histories&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
of a voyage down from St. Louis in skiff, shanty-boat,
and launch. What would they say if they read
his notes?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He had notepaper, blank books, and ink, and he set
about the weary task of keeping up his records, and
putting down all that he could recall of the contents of
his lost loose-leaf system. It was a staggering task.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In one record he wrote the habitual hour-to-hour
description, comment, talk, and fact; in his &#8220;memory
journal&#8221; he put down all the things he could recall
about the contents of his lost record. He had written
the things down to save him the difficulty of trying to
remember, but now he discovered that he had remembered.
A thousand times faster than he could write
the countless scenes and things he had witnessed flocked
back into the consciousness of his mind, pressing for
recognition and another chance to go down in black and
white.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>As he wrote, Parson Rasba, in the intervals of navigating
the big mission boat, would stand by gazing at
the furious energy of his companion. Rasba had seized
upon a few great facts of life, and dwelt in silent contemplation
of them, until a young woman with a library
disturbed the echoing halls of his mind, and
brought into them the bric-&agrave;-brac of the thought of the
ages. Now, from that brief experience, he could gaze
with nearer understanding at this young man who regarded
the pathway of the moon reflecting in a narrow
line across a sandbar and in a wide dancing of cold
blue flames upon the waters, as an important thing
to remember; who recorded the wavering flight of the
nigger geese, or cormorants, as compared to the magnificent
V-figure, straight drive of the Canadians and
the other huge water fowl; who paused to seize such
simple terms as &#8220;jump line,&#8221; &#8220;dough-bait,&#8221; &#8220;snag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
line,&#8221; &#8220;reef line,&#8221; as though his life might depend on his
verbal accuracy.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The Prophet pondered. The Mississippi had taught
him many lessons. He was beginning to look for the
lesson in casual phenomena, and when he said so to
Terabon, the writer stared at him with open mouth.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Explains what?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;The heathen who was awed by the myriad impressions
of Nature, and who learned, by hard experience,
that he must not neglect even the apparently trivial
things lest he suffer disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then Terabon fell to writing even more furiously
in his day-by-day journal, for that was something of
this moment, although he has just jotted down the renewed
impression of coming into the bottoms at Cape
Girardeau. Rasba took up the pages of the notes
which Terabon was rewriting. Happily, Terabon&#8217;s
writing was like copper-plate script, however fast he
wrote, and the mountain man read:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:0.0em; '>Big hickory tree grove&mdash;Columbus Hickories&mdash;Largest cane in
some bend down below Helena&mdash;Spanish Moss bend&mdash;famous river

for catfish down the crossings, half pound pork, or meat, for bait,
also called &#8220;blocking&#8221; for catfish.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What will you do with all this?&#8221; Rasba asked.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; Terabon hesitated, and then continued:
&#8220;It&#8217;s like building a house. I gather all this
material: lumber, stone, logs, cement, shingles, lathes,
quick-lime, bricks, and everything. I store it all up
in this notebook; that&#8217;s my lumber yard. Then when
I dig the foundation, I&#8217;ll come in here and I&#8217;ll find the
things I need to build my house, or mansion. Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
course, to start with, I&#8217;ll just build little shacks and
cabins. See what I mean? I am going to write
articles first and they&#8217;re kind of like barns and shacks,
and even mere fences. But by and by I&#8217;ll write
fiction stories, and they will be like the mansions, and
the material will all fit in: all about a fisherman, all
about a market hunter, all about a drifter, all about a
river&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;All about a river woman?&#8221; Rasba asked, as he hesitated.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking that.&#8221; Terabon shook his head,
his colour coming a little. &#8220;I had in mind, all about a
River Prophet!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; Rasba exclaimed. &#8220;What could you all find
to write about a Riveh Prophet?&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon looked at the stern, kindly, friendly, picturesque
mountaineer who had come so far to find one
man, for that man&#8217;s mother, and he rejoiced in his heart
to think that the parson did not know, could never
know, because of the honest simplicity of his heart, how
extraordinarily interesting he was.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>So they drifted with the current, absorbed in their
immediate present. It seemed as though they found
their comprehension expanding and widening till it
encompassed the answers to a thousand questions.
Rasba, dazed by his own accretion of new interests,
discovery of undreamed-of powers, seizure of opportunities
never known before, could but gaze with awe
and thankfulness at the evidences of his great good fortune,
the blessings that were his in spite of his wondering
why one of so little desert had received such bountiful
favour. Terabon, remembering what he feared was
irrevocably lost, knew that he had escaped disaster,
and that the pile of notes which he had made only to
be deprived of them were after all of less importance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
than that he should have suffered the deep emotion of
seeing so much of his toil and time vanish.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Here it was again&mdash;Rasba might well wonder at
that gathering and hoarding of trifles. They were not
the important things, those minute words and facts and
points; no, indeed.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>At last Terabon knew that most important fact of
all that it was the emotions that counted. As a mere
spectator, he could never hope to know the Mississippi,
to describe and write it truly; the river had forced
him into the activities of the river life, and had done
him by that act its finest service.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He was in the fervour of his most recent discovery
when Rasba went out on the bow deck and looked into
the night. He called Terabon a minute later, and the
two looked at a phenomenon. The west was aglow,
like a sunset, but with flarings and flashings instead of
slowly changing lights and hues. The light under the
clouds at the horizon extended through 90 degrees of
the compass, and in the centre of the bright greenish
flare there was a compact, black, apparently solid mass
from which streaks of lightning constantly exuded on
all sides.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>For a minute Terabon stared, cold chills goose-pimpling
his flesh. Then he cried:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Cyclone, Parson! Get ready!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They were opposite the head of a long bend near the
end of a big sandbar, and skirting the edge of an eddy,
near its foot. Terabon sprang into the gasolene
launch, started the motor, and steered for the shelter
of the west bank. In the quiet he and Rasba told each
other what to do.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba ran out two big anchors with big mooring
lines tied to them. He closed the bow door but opened
all the windows and other doors. Then, as they heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
the storm coming, they covered the launch with the
heavy canvas, heaved over the anchors into a fathom of
water, let out long lines, and played the launch out over
the stern on a heavy line fast to towing bits.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>A sweep of hail and rain was followed by a moment
of calm. Then a blast of wind, which scraped over the
cabin roof, was succeeded by the suck of the tornado,
which swept, a waterspout, across the river a quarter
of a mile down stream, struck a sandbar, and carried
up a golden yellow cloud of dust, which disappeared in
the gray blackness of a terrific downpour of rain.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They stretched out on their anchor lines till the
whole fabric of the cabin hummed and crackled with
the strain, but the lines held, and the windows being
open, prevented the semi-vacuum created by the storm&#8217;s
passing from &#8220;exploding&#8221; the boat, and tearing off
the cabin, or the roof.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>After the varying gusts and blasts the wind settled
down, colder by forty degrees, and with the steady white
of a norther. It meant days and nights of waiting
while the storm blew itself out. And when the danger
had passed and the boats were safe against the lines,
the two men turned in to sleep, more tired after their
adventures than they remembered ever being before.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In the morning rain was falling intermittently
with some sleet, but toward afternoon there was just a
cold wind. They built hot fires in their heater, burning
coal with which the gamblers had filled bow and stern
bins from coal barges somewhere up the river. Having
plenty to eat on board, there was nothing to worry
them.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon, his fountain pen racing, wrote for his own
distant Sunday Editor a narrative which excited the
compiler of the Magazine Supplement to deep oaths of
admiration for the fertile, prolific imagination of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
wandering writer&mdash;for who would believe in a romance
ready made?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The night of the big wind was followed by a day and
a night of gusts of wind and sleety rain; then followed
a day and a night of rising clouds, then a day when the
clouds were scattered and the sun was cold. That
day the sunset was grim, white, and freezing cold.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>In the morning there was a bright, warm sunrise,
a breath of sweet, soft air, and unimaginable brightness
and buoyancy, birds singing, squirrels barking,
and all the dismal pangs banished.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Shanty-boats shot out into the gay river and dotted
the wide surface up and down the current for miles.
The ears of the parson and the writer, keener with the
acuteness of distant sounds, could hear music from a
boat so far away that they could not see it, a wonderfully
enchanting experience.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They, too, ran out into the flood of sunshine to float
down with the rest.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>At the foot of Brandywine Bar a little cabin-boat
suddenly rowed out into the current and signalled them;
somebody recognized and wanted to speak to the
mission boat. They were rapidly sucking down the
swift chute current, but Terabon turned over the motor,
and flanked the big houseboat across the current so
that the hail could be answered.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The little cabin-boat, almost lost to view astern,
rapidly gained, and as they ran down Beef Island
chute, where the current is slow, they were overtaken.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; Parson Rasba cried aloud, &#8220;hit&#8217;s Missy
Carline, Missy Nelia, shore as I&#8217;m borned!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon had known it for half an hour. He had been
noticing river details, and he could not fail to recognize
that little boat. His hands trembled as he steered
the launch to take advantage of slack current and dead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
water, and his throat choked with an emotion which
he controlled with difficulty. He looked fearfully at
the gaunt River Prophet whose own cheeks were staining
with warm blood, and whose eyes gazed so keenly
at the young woman who was coming, leaning to her
sweeps with Viking grace and abandon.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She was coming to <i>them</i>, with the fatalistic certainty
that is so astonishing to the student observer. Carried
away by her sottish husband; threatened by the tornado;
rescued, perhaps, by the storm from worse
jeopardy, caught in safety under an island sandbar;
her eyes, sweeping the lonesome breadths of the
flowing river-sea, had seen and recognized her friend&#8217;s
boat, the floating mission, and pulled to join safe
company.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She rowed up, with her eyes on the Prophet. He
stood there in his majesty while Terabon stooped unnoticed
in the engine pit of the motorboat. Not till
she had run down near enough to throw a line did she
take her eyes off the mountain parson, and then she
turned and looked into the eyes, dumb with misery, of
the other man, Terabon.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Her cheeks, red with her exertions, turned white.
Three days she had read that heap of notes in loose-leaf
file which Terabon had written. She had read the lines
and between the lines, facts and ideas, descriptions
and reminiscence, dialogue and history, statistics and
appreciation of a thousand river things, all viewpoints,
including her own.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She knew, now, how wicked she was. She knew,
now, the wilfulness of her sins, and the merciful interposition
of the river&#8217;s inviolable strength. Her sight
of the mission boat had awakened in her soul the
knowledge that she must go out and talk to the good
man on board, confess her naughtiness, and beg the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
Prophet for instruction. Woman-like, she knew what
the outcome would be.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He would take her, protect her, and there would be
some way out of the predicament in which they both
found themselves. But again she reckoned without the
river. How could she know that Terabon and he had
come down the Mississippi together?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>But there he was, chauffeuring for the Prophet!</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She threw the line, Rasba caught it, drew the two
boats together and made them fast. He welcomed
her as a father might have welcomed a favourite child.
He threw over the anchor, and Terabon dropped the
launch back to the stern, and hung it there on a light
line.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When he entered the big cabin Nelia was sitting beside
a table, and Rasba was leaning against the shelves
which he had put up for the books. Nelia, dumbfounded,
had said little or nothing. When she glanced
up at Terabon, she looked away again, quickly, flushing.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She was lost now. That was her feeling. Her defiance
and her courage seemed to have utterly left her,
and in those bitter days of cold wind and clammy rain,
sleet and discomfort had changed the outlook of everything.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Married, without a husband; capable of great love,
and yet sure that she must never love; two lovers and
an unhappy marriage between her and happiness; a
mind made up to sin, wantonly, and a soul that taunted
her with a life-time of struggle against sordidness.
The two men saw her burst into tears and cry out in an
agony of spirit.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Dumbly they stood there, man-like, not knowing
what to do, or what thought was in the woman&#8217;s mind.
The Prophet Rasba, his face full of compassion, turned
from her and went aft through the alley into the kitchen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
closing the doors behind him. He knew, and with
knowledge he accepted the river fate.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Terabon went to her, and gave her comfort. He
talked to her as a lover should when his sweetheart is
in misery, her heart breaking. And she accepted his
gentleness, and sobbed out the impossibility of everything,
while she clung to him.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Within the hour they had plighted troth, regardless.
She confessed to her lover, instead of to the Prophet.
He said he didn&#8217;t care, and she said she didn&#8217;t care,
either&mdash;which was mutually satisfactory.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>When they went out to Parson Rasba, they found him
calmly reading one of the books which she had given
him. He looked up at their red faces and smiled with
indulgence. They would never know what went on
inside his heart, what was in his mind behind that kindly
smile. That he knew and understood everything was
clear to them, but they did not and would not have
believed that he had, for a minute, hated Terabon as
standing between him and happiness.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; Terabon cried, when he
had told the Parson that they loved each other, that
they would complete the voyage down the river together,
that her husband still lived, and that they could
get a $17.50 divorce at Memphis.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Hit wouldn&#8217;t be no &#8217;count, that divorce.&#8221; The
Prophet shrugged his shoulders, and the two hung their
heads. They knew it, and yet they had been willing
to plead ignorance as an excuse for sin.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>He seemed to close the incident by suggesting that
it was time to eat something, and the three turned to
getting a square meal. They cooked a bountiful
dinner, and sat down to it, the Prophet asking a blessing
that seared the hearts of the two because of its fervour.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Rasba asked her to read to them after they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
cleared up the dishes, and she took down the familiar
volumes and read. Rasba sat with his eyes closed,
listening. Terabon watched her face. She seemed
to choose the pages at random, and read haphazardly,
but it was all delight and all poetry.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She was reading, which was strange, the Humphrey-Abbott
book about the Mississippi River levees, the
classic report on river facts, all fascinating to the mind
that grasps with pleasure any river fact. When Rasba
looked up and smiled, the two were absorbed in their
occupations, one reading, the other watching her read.
She stopped in conscious confusion.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Yas, suh!&#8221; he smiled aloud. &#8220;I &#8217;low we uns can
leave hit to Old Mississip&#8217;, these yeah things that
trouble us: I, my triflin&#8217; doubts, and you children yo&#8217;
own don&#8217;t-know-yets.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>What made him say that, if he wasn&#8217;t a River
Prophet? Who told him, what voice informed him, at
that moment? Who can say?</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The following morning the big mission boat and
Missy Nelia&#8217;s boat landed in at Memphis wharf, and
the three went up town to buy groceries, newspapers
and magazines to read, and to help Nelia choose another
set of books from the shelves of local book stores.
Old Rasba had never been in a book store before, and
he stared at the hundreds of feet of shelves, with books
of all sizes, kinds, and makes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;Sho!&#8221; he cried aloud, and then, again, &#8220;Sho!
Sho!&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was fairyland for him, a land of enchantment,
of impossible satisfaction and glory-be! Terabon and
Nelia saw that they had given him another pleasure,
and Rasba was happy to know that he would always
be able to visit such places, and add to his own store of
literature, when he had read the books which he had,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
as he would do, page by page, and word by word, his
dictionary at hand.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Magazines and newspapers had little interest for him.
Nelia and Terabon could not help but wish to keep
closer in touch with the world. They picked up a
copy of the <i>Trade-Appealer</i>, and then a copy of the
<i>Evening Battle Ax</i>, just out.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They read one headline:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; text-align:center'>UNKNOWN DROWNS IN CRUISER<br /></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>It was a brutally frank description of a motorboat
cruiser which had floated down Hopefield Bend, awash
and waterlogged, but held afloat by air-tight tanks:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:0.0em; '>In the cabin was the body of a man, apparently about 30 years of
age, with a whiskey jug clasped in one hand by the handle. He
was face downward, and had been dead two or three days. It is
supposed he was caught in the heavy wind-storm of Wednesday
night and drowned.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>The river had planned again. The river had acted
again. They went to look at the boat, which was
pumped out and in Ash Slough. It was Carline&#8217;s
cruiser. Then they went to the morgue, and it was
Carline&#8217;s body.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Nelia broke down and cried. After all, one&#8217;s husband
is one&#8217;s husband. She did the right thing. She
owned him, now, and she carried his remains back home
to Gage, and there she buried him, and wept on his
grave.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>She put on widow&#8217;s weeds for him, and though she
might have claimed his property, she ignored the will
which left her all of it, and gave to his relatives and to
her own poor people what was theirs. She gave Parson
Rasba, whom she had brought home with her to
bury her husband, $5,000 for his services.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>Then, after the estate was all settled up, she returned
to Memphis, and Terabon met her at the Union
Station, dutifully, as she had told him to do. Together
they went to the City Clerk&#8217;s and obtained a marriage
license, and the River Prophet, Rasba, with firm voice
and unflinching gaze, united them in wedlock.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>They went aboard their own little shanty-boat, and
while the rice and old shoes of a host of river people
rattled and clattered on their cabin, they drifted out
into the current and rapidly slipped away toward
President&#8217;s Island. Parson Rasba, as they drifted
clear, said to them:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:-1.0em; '>&#8220;I &#8217;lowed we uns could leave hit to Old Mississip&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
